While the macroeconomic \nenvironment with elevated interest rates has affected \nequity capital investment and hiring, underlying \nindicators—including optimism, innovation, and longer-\nterm talent needs—reflect a positive long-term trajectory \nin the 15 technology trends we analyzed. \nThese are among the findings in the latest McKinsey \nTechnology Trends Outlook, in which the McKinsey \nTechnology Council identified the most significant \ntechnology trends unfolding today (to know more about \nthe Council, see the sidebar “About the McKinsey \nTechnology Council”). This research is intended to help \nexecutives plan ahead by developing an understanding \nof potential use cases, sources of value, adoption drivers, \nand the critical skills needed to bring these opportunities \nto fruition. \nOur analysis examines quantitative measures of \ninterest, innovation, investment, and talent to gauge the \nmomentum of each trend. Recognizing the long-term \nnature and interdependence of these trends, we also \ndelve into the underlying technologies, uncertainties, \nand questions surrounding each trend. (For more about \nnew developments in our research, please see the \nsidebar “What’s new in this year’s analysis” on page 9; for \nmore about the research itself, please see the sidebar \n“Research methodology” on pages 10–11.)\nNew and notable\nThe two trends that stood out in 2023 were gen AI and \nelectrification and renewables. Gen AI has seen a spike \nof almost 700 percent in Google searches from 2022 \nto 2023, along with a notable jump in job postings and \ninvestments. The pace of technology innovation has \nbeen remarkable. Over the course of 2023 and 2024, \nthe size of the prompts that large language models \n(LLMs) can process, known as “context windows,” spiked \nfrom 100,000 to two million tokens. This is roughly the \ndifference between adding one research paper to a \nmodel prompt and adding about 20 novels to it. And the \nmodalities that gen AI can process have continued to \nincrease, from text summarization and image generation \nto advanced capabilities in video, images, audio, and text. \nThis has catalyzed a surge in investments and innovation \naimed at advancing more powerful and efficient \ncomputing systems.\nThe large foundation models that power generative \nAI, such as LLMs, are being integrated into various \nenterprise software tools and are also being employed \nfor diverse purposes such as powering customer-facing \nchatbots, generating ad campaigns, accelerating \ndrug discovery, and more. We expect this expansion \nto continue, pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. \nSenior leaders’ awareness of gen AI innovation has \nincreased interest, investment, and innovation in \nAI technologies and other trends, such as robotics, \nwhich is a new addition to our trends analysis this year. \nAdvancements in AI are ushering in a new era of more \ncapable robots, spurring greater innovation and a wider \nrange of deployments. \nAbout the McKinsey Technology Council\nTechnology is a catalyst for new opportunities, from inventing new products and services, \nexpanding the productivity frontier and capturing more value in our day-to-day work. The \nMcKinsey Technology Council helps business leaders understand frontier technologies and the \npotential application to their businesses.\nWe look at a spectrum of technologies, from generative AI, machine learning, and quantum \ncomputing to space technologies that are shaping new opportunities and applications. The McKinsey \nTechnology Council convenes a global group of more than 100 scientists, entrepreneurs, researchers, \nand business leaders. We research, debate, and advise executives from all industries as they navigate the \nfast-changing technology landscape.\n—Lareina Yee, senior partner, McKinsey; chair, McKinsey Technology Council\n4Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nElectrification and renewables was the other \ntrend that bucked the economic headwinds, \nposting the highest investment and interest \nscores among all the trends we evaluated. \nJob postings for this sector also showed a \nmodest increase. \nAlthough many trends faced declines in \ninvestment and hiring in 2023, the long-term \noutlook remains positive. This optimism is \nsupported by the continued longer-term \ngrowth in job postings for the analyzed \ntrends (up 8 percent from 2021 to 2023) \nand enterprises’ continued innovation and \nheightened interest in harnessing these \ntechnologies, particularly for future growth. \nIn 2023, technology equity investments \nfell by 30 to 40 percent to approximately \n$570 billion due to rising financing costs \nand a cautious near-term growth outlook, \nprompting investors to favor technologies \nwith strong revenue and margin potential. \nThis approach aligns with the strategic \nperspective leading companies are \nadopting, in which they recognize that \nfully adopting and scaling cutting-edge \ntechnologies is a long-term endeavor. This \nrecognition is evident when companies \ndiversify their investments across a \nportfolio of several technologies, selectively \nintensifying their focus on areas most likely \nto push technological boundaries forward. \nWhile many technologies have maintained \ncautious investment profiles over the past \nyear, gen AI saw a sevenfold increase \nin investments, driven by substantial \nadvancements in text, image, and video \ngeneration. \nDespite an overall downturn in private \nequity investment, the pace of innovation \nhas not slowed. Innovation has accelerated \nin the three trends that are part of the “AI \nrevolution” group: generative AI, applied AI, \nand industrializing machine learning. Gen \nAI creates new content from unstructured \ndata (such as text and images), applied \nAI leverages machine learning models \nfor analytical and predictive tasks, and \nindustrializing machine learning accelerates \nand derisks the development of machine \nlearning solutions. Applied AI and \nindustrializing machine learning, boosted by \nthe widening interest in gen AI, have seen \nthe most significant uptick in innovation, \nreflected in the surge in publications and \npatents from 2022 to 2023. Meanwhile, \nelectrification and renewable-energy \ntechnologies continue to capture high \ninterest, reflected in news mentions and \nweb searches. Their popularity is fueled \nby a surge in global renewable capacity, \ntheir crucial roles in global decarbonization \nefforts, and heightened energy security \nneeds amid geopolitical tensions and  \nenergy crises.\nThe talent environment largely echoed the \ninvestment picture in tech trends in 2023. \nThe technology sector faced significant \nlayoffs, particularly among large technology \ncompanies, with job postings related to  \nthe tech trends we studied declining by  \n26 percent—a steeper drop than the  \n17 percent decrease in global job postings \noverall. The greater decline in demand for \ntech-trends-related talent may have been \nfueled by technology companies’ cost \nreduction efforts amid decreasing revenue \ngrowth projections. Despite this reduction, \nthe trends with robust investment and \ninnovation, such as generative AI, not only \nmaintained but also increased their job \npostings, reflecting a strong demand for \nnew and advanced skills. Electrification and \nrenewables was the other trend that saw \npositive job growth, partially due to public \nsector support for infrastructure spending. \nEven with the short-term vicissitudes in \ntalent demand, our analysis of 4.3 million \njob postings across our 15 tech trends \nunderscored a wide skills gap. Compared \nwith the global average, fewer than half of \npotential candidates have the high-demand \ntech skills specified in job postings. Despite \nthe year-on-year decreases for job postings \nin many trends from 2022 to 2023, the \nnumber of tech-related job postings in 2023 \nstill represented an 8 percent increase from \n2021, suggesting the potential for longer-\nterm growth (Exhibit 1).\n+8%\n−\n17%\n−\n26%\ntech trends job postings \nfrom 2021 to 2023\nglobal job postings \nfrom 2022 to 2023\ntech trends job postings \nfrom 2022 to 2023\n5Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nClimate technologies \nbeyond electri\rcation \nand renewables\nIndustrializing\nmachine learning\nImmersive-reality \ntechnologies\nFuture of mobilityApplied AINext-generation\nsoftware\ndevelopment\nFuture of\nbioengineering\nAdvanced\nconnectivity\nFuture of\nrobotics\nQuantum\ntechnologies\nFuture of space \ntechnologies\nGenerative\nAI\nDigital trust and \ncybersecurity\nElectri\rcation\nand renewables\nCloud and edge\ncomputing\n20212023\n20212023\nAnnual change in tech trend job postings, 2021–23, millions of postings¹\nDespite a one-year drop in job postings, demand for jobs in many \ntechnology trends has increased over two years.\nClimate technologies \nbeyond electri\rcation \nand renewables\nIndustrializing\nmachine learning\nImmersive-reality \ntechnologies\nFuture of mobilityApplied AINext-generation\nsoftware\ndevelopment\nFuture of\nbioengineering\nAdvanced\nconnectivity\nFuture of\nrobotics\nQuantum\ntechnologies\nFuture of space \ntechnologies\nGenerative\nAI\nDigital trust and \ncybersecurity\nElectri\rcation\nand renewables \n1\nOut of 130 million surveyed job postings (extrapolated Jan–Oct 2023).

This pattern is evident in this year’s survey analysis \nof enterprise adoption conducted across our 15 \ntechnologies. Adoption levels vary across different \nindustries and company sizes, as does the perceived \nprogress toward adoption.\nWe see that the technologies in the S-curve’s early \nstages of innovation and experimenting are either \non the leading edge of progress, such as quantum \ntechnologies and robotics, or are more relevant to \na specific set of industries, such as bioengineering \nand space. Factors that could affect the adoption of \nthese technologies include high costs, specialized \napplications, and balancing the breadth of technology \ninvestments against focusing on a select few that may \noffer substantial first-mover advantages. \nAs technologies gain traction and move beyond \nexperimenting, adoption rates start accelerating, and \ncompanies invest more in piloting and scaling. We see \nthis shift in a number of trends, such as next-generation \nsoftware development and electrification. Gen AI’s rapid \nadvancement leads among trends analyzed, with about \na quarter of respondents self-reporting that they are \nscaling its use. More mature technologies, like cloud  \nand edge computing and advanced connectivity, \ncontinued their rapid pace of adoption, serving \nas enablers for the adoption of other emerging \ntechnologies as well (Exhibit 3). \n7Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nSelf-reported adoption level by tech trend, 2023,\u001f % of respondents\n\u0014Respondents may interpret these categories di\u000berently based on their organizations. As such, the results should be considered as indicative of organizations’ \nself-assessments, rather than precise measurements. For a deeper look at our AI-related trends, see “The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes \nand starts to generate value,” McKinsey, May 30, 2024.\n Source: McKinsey technology adoption survey data\nMore-mature technologies are more widely adopted, often serving as \nenablers for more-nascent technologies.\nMcKinsey & Company\nExperimentingNot investingPilotingScalingFully scaled\nWeb <2024>\n<TechTrends-L1>\nExhibit <2> of <3>\n22\n17\n10\n11\n8\n10\n7\n8\n5\n5\n4\n3\n5\n3\n14\n14\n18\n18\n14\n18\n17\n16\n18\n16\n18\n17\n22\n18\n15\n25\n33\n26\n26\n37\n37\n37\n37\n45\n46\n43\n50\n41\n47\n57\n13\n16\n20\n21\n18\n15\n19\n20\n16\n18\n20\n15\n19\n20\n13\n26\n20\n26\n24\n23\n20\n20\n19\n16\n15\n15\n15\n13\n15\n12\nDigital trust and cybersecurity\nNext-generation software development \nFuture of space technologies\nQuantum technologies\nFuture of robotics\nFuture of bioengineering\nFuture of mobility\nClimate technologies beyond electrication and\nrenewables\nImmersive-reality technologies\nIndustrializing machine learning\nElectrication and renewables\nApplied AI\nAdvanced connectivity\nGenerative AI\nCloud and edge computing\nExhibit 3\nThe process of scaling technology adoption also \nrequires a conducive external ecosystem where user \ntrust and readiness, business model economics, \nregulatory environments, and talent availability play \ncrucial roles. Since these ecosystem factors vary by \ngeography and industry, we see different adoption \nscenarios playing out. For instance, while the leading \nbanks in Latin America are on par with their North \nAmerican counterparts in deploying gen AI use cases, \nthe adoption of robotics in manufacturing sectors varies \nsignificantly due to differing labor costs affecting the \nbusiness case for automation. \nAs executives navigate these complexities, they \nshould align their long-term technology adoption \nstrategies with both their internal capacities and \nthe external ecosystem conditions to ensure the \nsuccessful integration of new technologies into \ntheir business models. Executives should monitor \necosystem conditions that can affect their prioritized \nuse cases to make decisions about the appropriate \ninvestment levels while navigating uncertainties and \nbudgetary constraints on the way to full adoption (see \nthe “Adoption developments across the globe” sections \nwithin each trend that showcase examples of adoption \ndimensions for the trends or particular use cases therein \nthat executives should monitor). Across the board, \nleaders who take a long-term view—building up their \ntalent, testing and learning where impact can be found, \nand reimagining the businesses for the future—can \npotentially break out ahead of the pack.  \n8Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\n9Technology Trends Outlook 2024\nThe 15 tech trends\nThis report lays out considerations for all 15 technology \ntrends. For easier consideration of related trends, \nwe grouped them into five broader categories: the AI \nrevolution, building the digital future, compute and \nconnectivity frontiers, cutting-edge engineering, and a \nsustainable world. Of course, there’s significant power \nand potential in looking across these groupings when \nconsidering trend combinations. \nTo describe the state of each trend, we developed scores \nfor innovation (based on patents and research) and \ninterest (based on news and web searches). We also \nsized investments in relevant technologies and rated \ntheir level of adoption by organizations (Exhibit 4). \nWhat’s new in this year’s analysis\nThis year, we reflected the shifts in the \ntechnology landscape with two changes on the \nlist of trends: digital trust and cybersecurity \n(integrating what we had previously described \nas Web3 and trust architectures) and the future \nof robotics. Robotics technologies’ synergy \nwith AI is paving the way for groundbreaking \ninnovations and operational shifts across the \neconomic and workforce landscapes.

All 15 trends exhibit high levels of innovation and interest compared with \nother topics and are also attracting significant investment.\n1\nThe innovation score combines the 0–1 scores for patents and research, which are relative to the trends studied. The patents score is based on a measure \nof patent filings, and the research score is based on a measure of research publications.\n2\nThe interest score combines the 0–1 scores for news and searches, which are relative to the trends studied. The news score is based on a measure of news \npublications, and the searches score is based on a measure of search engine queries.\nExhibit 4\n\nResearch methodology\nTo assess the development of each technology trend, our team collected data on five tangible \nmeasures of activity: search engine queries, news publications, patents, research publications, \nand investment. For each measure, we used a defined set of data sources to find occurrences of \nkeywords associated with each of the 15 trends, screened those occurrences for valid mentions \nof activity, and indexed the resulting numbers of mentions on a 0–1 scoring scale that is relative \nto the trends studied. The innovation score combines the patents and research scores; the \ninterest score combines the news and search scores. (While we recognize that an interest \nscore can be inflated by deliberate efforts to stimulate news and search activity, we believe that \neach score fairly reflects the extent of discussion and debate about a given trend.) Investment \nmeasures the flows of funding from the capital markets into companies linked with the trend. \nData sources for the scores include the following:\n —Patents. Data on patent filings are sourced from Google Patents, where the data highlight \nthe number of granted patents.\n —Research. Data on research publications are sourced from Lens.\n —News. Data on news publications are sourced from Factiva.\n —Searches. Data on search engine queries are sourced from Google Trends.\n —Investment. Data on private-market and public-market capital raises (venture capital and \ncorporate and strategic M&A, including joint ventures), private equity (including buyouts and \nprivate investment in public equity), and public investments (including IPOs) are sourced from \nPitchBook.\n —Talent demand. Number of job postings is sourced from McKinsey’s proprietary \nOrganizational Data Platform, which stores licensed, de-identified data on professional \nprofiles and job postings. Data are drawn primarily from English-speaking countries.\nIn addition, we updated the selection and definition of trends from last year’s report to reflect \nthe evolution of technology trends:\n —The future of robotics trend was added since last year’s publication.\n —Data sources and keywords were updated. For data on the future of space technologies \ninvestments, we used research from McKinsey’s Aerospace & Defense Practice.\n10Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nResearch methodology \n(continued)\nFinally, we used survey data to calculate the enterprise-wide adoption scores for each trend:\n —Survey scope. The survey included approximately 1,000 respondents from 50 countries.\n —Geographical coverage. Survey representation was balanced across Africa, Asia, Europe, \nLatin America, the Middle East, and North America.\n —Company size. Size categories, based on annual revenue, included small companies \n($10 million to $50 million), medium-size companies ($50 million to $1 billion), and large \ncompanies (greater than $1 billion).\n —Respondent profile. The survey was targeted to senior-level professionals knowledgeable \nin technology, who reported their perception of the extent to which their organizations were \nusing the technologies.\n —Survey method. The survey was conducted online to enhance reach and accessibility.\n —Question types. The survey employed multiple-choice and open-ended questions for \ncomprehensive insights.\n —Definition of enterprise-wide adoption scores:\n• 1: Frontier innovation. This technology is still nascent, with few organizations investing in or \napplying it. It is largely untested and unproven in a business context.\n• 2: Experimentation. Organizations are testing the functionality and viability of the \ntechnology with a small-scale prototype, typically done without a strong focus on a near-\nterm ROI. Few companies are scaling or have fully scaled the technology.\n• 3: Piloting. Organizations are implementing the technology for the first few business use \ncases. It may be used in pilot projects or limited deployments to test its feasibility and \neffectiveness.\n• 4: Scaling.

Gen AI models \nare trained on vast, diverse data sets. They take unstructured \ndata, such as text, as inputs and produce unique outputs—also \nin the form of unstructured data—ranging from text and code to \nimages, music, and 3D models. \nOver the past year, we’ve seen remarkable advancements in \nthis field, with text generation models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, \nAnthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini producing content that \nmimics human-generated responses, as well as with image-\ngeneration tools such as DALL-E 3 and Midjourney creating \nphotorealistic images from text descriptions. OpenAI’s recent \nlaunch of Sora, a text-to-video generator, further showcases \nthe technology’s potential. Even music composition is being \nrevolutionized, with models such as Suno creating original pieces  \nin various styles. \nGen AI has sparked widespread interest, with individuals and \norganizations across different regions and industries exploring its \npotential. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on the \nstate of AI, 65 percent of respondents say their organizations are \nregularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from \none-third last year,\n1\n and gen AI use cases have the potential to \ngenerate an annual value of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion.\n2\n  \nHowever, it’s important to recognize the risks that accompany the \nuse of this powerful technology, including bias, misinformation, and \ndeepfakes. As we progress through 2024 and beyond, we anticipate \norganizations investing in the risk mitigation, operating model, \ntalent, and technological capabilities required to scale gen AI. \nTalent demand Ratio\nof skilled people\nto job vacancies\nEquity investment \nPrivate- and public- \nmarket capital raises for \nrelevant technologies\nPatents Patent\n\u0006lings for technologies \nrelated to trend\nNews Press reports \nfeaturing trend-\nrelated phrases\nSearches Search \nengine queries for \nterms related to\ntrend\nResearch Scienti\u0006c \npublications on topics \nassociated with trend\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nNews\nTalent demand\nResearch\nSearches\n1.0\nPatents\nEquity\ninvestment\nScoring the trend\nTHE AI REVOLUTION\nScore by vector (0 = lower; 1 = higher)\nGenerative AI\nGen AI saw a surge in 2023, driven by ChatGPT’s \nlate-2022 launch, alongside earlier models such as \nDALLE 2 and Stable Diusion.

As \ngen AI continues to evolve and gain more attention in \nvarious industries, it’s becoming increasingly clear that \nmultimodality will play a pivotal role. By combining text, \nimages, sounds, and videos, AI models can generate \noutputs applicable across a wide range of industries \nand business functions. This pursuit of multimodality \nis intensifying across leading players such as OpenAI \nand Google (with its Lumiere AI web app). For example, \nGoogle’s Gemini showcases a powerful multimodal \nsystem capable of processing information in various \nformats, including text, code, tables, images, and  \neven audio. \n —Powerful open-source models are challenging their \nclosed-source counterparts in performance and \ndeveloper adoption. While significant investments \nare encouraging the development of proprietary large \nlanguage models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 with vision \n(GPT-4V), the AI community is also witnessing a surge in \nopen-source models, such as Llama 3. This momentum \nis fueled by the enthusiasm of developers and users  \nwho welcome the unprecedented access to build \ninnovative tools and study complex systems. The \naccessibility of open-source models is attracting a \ngrowing developer base.\n —The context window in natural-language processing \n(NLP) is expanding. This expansion allows for longer and \nsmarter prompts. For instance, in early 2024, Google \nreleased the largest context window in the market with \nGemini 1.5 Pro, which has a standard context window of \n128,000 tokens, with the potential to reach two million \ntokens.\n3\n This larger context window enables the model \nto generate more coherent and contextually relevant \nresponses by considering a larger amount of text. \nHowever, expanding prompt size can paradoxically lead \nto models getting “lost in the middle,” as they tend to \nfocus on specific parts of the text while avoiding the rest.\n —LLMs are increasingly being embedded into various \nenterprise tools. We are witnessing a significant uptick \nin the integration of LLMs into various enterprise \ntools. This surge is fueled by the growing demand for \nautomation, efficiency, personalized user experiences, \nand the capacity to decipher complex patterns that \ncan lead to actionable insights. Consequently, a rising \nnumber of vendors are choosing to integrate LLMs into \ntheir applications and tools. This trend is especially \nprominent in the marketing and customer care domains, \nwith Salesforce Einstein and ServiceNow serving as \nprime examples.\n —The multiagent approach has gained significant traction \nwith the rapid development of LLMs and continued \ninnovation. Companies now recognize the benefits \nof employing multiple language models that work in \nharmony rather than relying on a single model. This \napproach offers a fresh perspective on tackling complex \nchallenges by leveraging the capabilities of multiple AI \nagents, each specializing in different domains, to solve \na single problem collaboratively. By working together, \nthese agents can not only accelerate problem-solving \nbut also leverage varied perspectives and expertise to \ndeliver more effective and efficient solutions. Some  \nof the tools using this approach tend to be unstable,  \nbut as models improve, their throughput should \nsignificantly increase, making them increasingly  \nrelevant for the future.\n3\n The Keyword [Google’s official blog], “Gemini breaks new ground with a faster model, longer context, AI agents and more,” blog entry by Demis Hassabis,  \nMay 14, 2024.\n15Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nJob postings by title, 2019–23, thousands\nDemand\nGenerative AI\nTalent and labor markets\nRoles related to gen AI have experienced signi\ncant and rapid growth in talent demand since 2019, with a 111 \npercent increase in job postings compared with 2023.

This underscores its significance as a \npivotal, high-growth trend to closely monitor throughout  \nthe year.\nMany companies have made progress throughout the year \non adopting gen AI and are currently working on scaling \nit across their businesses. While gen AI adoption has \nsurged across various sectors, the technology, media, and \ntelecommunications sector has notably emerged as a leader \nin the deployment of the technology. \nThe lack of availability of local language support poses \nchallenges to adoption globally. Some countries, including \nIndia, Japan, and countries in the Middle East, have pushed \nto develop their own LLMs. In Africa, the prioritization of \ndata locality and proximity hampers the building of LLMs. \nSignificant progress has been made recently with the \nemergence of multilingual models. Multilingual capabilities \ncould become essential for any LLM, with the primary focus \nshifting to the degree of localization, including the use of \nslang, technical terms, and other nuances.\nAdoption dimensions\nThe adoption trajectory of advanced technologies varies for \neach technology and each use case within that technology. \nAdvancements along the following dimensions could enable \nreaching the next level of adoption for gen AI:\n —a clearly defined ROI for widespread horizontal and \nvertical use cases by sector, along with a demonstrated \nability to control risks and ensure safety with the \ndevelopment and deployment of new AI solutions\n —decreased computational costs, alongside improvement \nin overall AI efficiencies (for example, improving latency) \n‘Since gen AI captured public attention at the end of \n2022, a significant amount of focus has been placed on \ndelivering value through foundation models. Many are \nalready demonstrating cross-industry value, such as \ncoding acceleration or sales and marketing use cases, \nas well as domain-specific models, such as protein \nengineering or chemistry discovery foundation models. \nThe field continues to improve quickly with new tools—\nfor example, multimodal, agent-based models. Companies \nshould concentrate on building capabilities in this domain \nand prioritize areas of focus to ensure they capture early \nvalue and aren’t left behind.’ \n– Matej Macak, partner, London \n17Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nIn real life \nReal-world examples involving the use of gen AI include  \nthe following:\n —ING, a global financial institution, leveraged gen AI to \nenhance customer service in the Netherlands, one of its \nkey markets.\n4\n While the current classic chatbot usually \nresolves 40 to 45 percent of those chats, that leaves \nanother 16,500 customers a week who need to speak \nwith a live agent for help. Recognizing gen AI’s potential, \nING developed a bespoke customer-facing chatbot to \nprovide immediate, tailored assistance. This resulted \nin helping 20 percent more customers avoid long wait \ntimes and offering instant gratification in the first seven \nweeks of use compared with the previous solution. The \nchatbot is expected to reach 37 million customers as it \nexpands across ten markets.\n —Recursion, a biotech company, has developed a new \ngen AI platform and trained an LLM to accelerate \ndrug discovery. This platform enables scientists to \nsimultaneously access multiple machine learning \nmodels that can process large amounts of proprietary \nbiological and chemical data sets to save time during \ndrug development.\n —Itaú Unibanco, Latin America’s largest private sector \nbank, created ad campaigns dedicated to women \nfootball athletes using AI.\n5\n The campaign highlighted \na 1941 Brazilian law that banned women from playing \nfootball. It used AI-generated images from conversations \nwith real players and historians, among others, to create \nthe “Brazilian teams that have never existed” campaign, \npaving the way for a new generation of AI-based media \nadvertising. \n —Nubank is piloting a gen AI virtual assistant to boost \ncustomer service.\n6\n The virtual assistant focuses on \ndelivering personalized credit-related options within \nthe Nubank ecosystem. It helps customers understand \ntheir credit card usage, explore collateralized credit \nopportunities, and use its online payment service NuPay \nwithout affecting their credit limits. Additionally, it may \noffer personal loans based on the customer’s profile \nand eligibility. For the initial phase, this innovative \nsolution will be available exclusively to members of \nNuCommunity, Nubank’s customer engagement \nplatform. The assistant, developed using GPT-4 and \nNubank’s proprietary tools, was designed to evolve and \nimprove through continuous customer interactions, \nensuring a dynamic, customer-focused service.\nUnderlying technologies\nMultiple types of software and hardware power gen AI \nacross the entire tech stack. These include the following:\n —Application layer. Typically, this is the interface that the \nend user interacts with (for example, chat).\n —Integration/tooling layer. Sitting between the application \nlayer and foundation model, this layer integrates with \nother systems to retrieve information, filter responses, \nsave inputs and outputs, distribute work, and enable \nnew features. Examples include the large-language-\nprogramming framework LangChain and vector \ndatabases such as Pinecone and Weaviate.  \n —Foundation models. These are deep learning models \ntrained on vast quantities of unstructured, unlabeled \ndata that can be used for a wide range of tasks out of the \nbox or adapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning.\n —Digital infrastructure. This involves using the digital \nabstraction of physical infrastructure to support \ndata storage, processing, and computation. Digital \nabstraction includes databases (for example, SQL and \nNoSQL) and core tech services (for example, compute, \nstorage, and networking). \n —Physical infrastructure. This encompasses hardware that \nenables computational, data storage, and networking \nneeds, including data centers, AI accelerator chips, \nand data center mechanical, electrical, and plumbing \ntechnologies. \n4\n “Banking on innovation: How ING uses generative AI to put people first,” McKinsey, accessed May 2024.\n5\n “Brazilian teams that have never existed,” Ads of the World, Clio Awards, accessed May 2024.\n6\n “Nubank begins testing with generative artificial intelligence to enhance customers’ experience with credit,” Nubank press release, October 18, 2023.\n18Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nKey uncertainties \nThe major uncertainties affecting gen AI include the \nfollowing:\n —Cybersecurity and privacy concerns are prevalent, \nnotably regarding data leakage risks and vulnerabilities \n(including customer and protected data). \n —Ethical considerations surround the responsible use of \ngen AI, including data governance, justice and fairness, \naccountability, and explainability.\n —Regulation and compliance might affect research into \ngen AI and its potential applications.\n —Copyright ownership and protection of content \ngenerated by open-source models remains an \nunanswered question.\n —Environmental impact may increase as training models \nexpend exponentially more computational resources. \n —Inaccuracies are the most recognized and experienced \nrisk for gen AI uses,\n7\n and they can affect use cases \nacross the gen AI value chain. \nBig questions about the future\nCompanies and leaders may want to consider a few \nquestions when moving forward with gen AI:\n —How will the cost of model creation evolve, and how will it \naffect competitive dynamics?\n —Will enterprise adoption experience the same level \nof exponential growth and monetization as seen in \nconsumer adoption?\n —How will the market develop in terms of open-source \nsolutions versus closed-source?\n —How should companies approach gen-AI-related risks, \nincluding data privacy and security, equity, fairness, \ncompliance, and copyright protections?\n —What strategies should policy makers adopt to address \nthe risk of social engineering from third-party LLM \nsolutions?\n —When will error rates and avoidance of hallucinations get \nto an acceptable level for large-scale implementations of \ngen AI in everyday use cases?\n —Which workers will see their roles shift due to gen AI, and \nto what extent will they be affected?\n —As technological advancements such as gen AI models, \naccelerators, and throughput continue to evolve, what \nare the primary use cases that companies should \nprioritize, and how should they position themselves for \nfuture relevance in terms of their degree of involvement, \nwhether as shapers, takers, or makers?\n19Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n7\n “The state of AI in early 2024,” May 30, 2024.\n‘Gen AI is currently at the exciting nexus of demonstrated \nproof of value, rapid innovation, significant public and private \ninvestment, and widespread consumer interest.

Companies are using data \nto derive insights to automate processes, transform businesses, \nand make better decisions. McKinsey research estimates that \nAI applications can potentially unlock an economic value of $11 \ntrillion to $18 trillion annually.\n1 \n The excitement around generative \nAI (gen AI) has led to increasing awareness of the potential value \nof applied AI. In our recent global survey on the state of AI in 2024, \n67 percent of respondents say they expect their organizations to \ninvest more in AI over the next three years.\n2\n The survey highlights \nthat organizations continue to see returns from AI efforts across \nbusiness domains. Regulators and policy makers alike are \nalso taking note of AI’s increasing impact, with the European \nParliament, for example, passing the unified EU Artificial \nIntelligence Act.\n3\n  \nHowever, the journey to AI adoption is filled with challenges \nand learning opportunities, such as transforming organizational \nculture to foster collaboration, trust, and adaptation to new \nways of working; acquiring, leveraging, and organizing valuable \nsources of large data sets; and interpreting model outputs to build \nend-user trust in them.

Rich, high-\nquality data sets are essential assets for capturing value \nfrom AI. The shift toward data-centric AI represents a \nsignificant evolution in the field, as capabilities such \nas picking the right model or hyperparameter tuning \nbecome more automated and easier to use. Data-centric \nAI use cases are diverse and widespread, but specific \nexamples include financial institutions using it to detect \nand prevent fraudulent activities, healthcare providers \npromoting transparency in AI-driven diagnoses, or \nmanufacturers identifying potential biases in quality \ncontrol systems. A company’s unique data can be \nused to train AI models to automate and optimize core \nprocesses and unlock new business potential. Having \naccess to unique data sets can provide a distinct \ncompetitive advantage, which explains why companies \nsuch as OpenAI are actively seeking new data and \npurchasing exclusive rights. \nAs companies build their own private AI environments, \nthe scope of data governance will expand beyond \nprivacy to address interconnected threats such as data \npoisoning (for example, tampering with the training \ndata) and model hijacking (for instance, taking control \nof an existing model and manipulating it to perform \nunauthorized tasks). This transition requires robust data \npractices, including maintaining data quality, tracing \ndata lineage, and employing explainable AI to foster trust \nand reduce bias. \n —Hardware acceleration has gained significant \nmomentum in applied AI. The continuous increase \nin the scale and complexity of deep learning models \nhas surpassed the abilities of conventional central \nprocessing units, accelerating hardware development. \nTo train these large models and operate them in real \ntime, organizations are shifting toward specialized \nhardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs), \nfield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application-\nspecific integrated circuits (ASICs), and high-bandwidth \nmemory (HBM) chips. Originally designed for graphics, \nGPUs now provide the parallel processing power \nneeded for AI tasks. FPGAs offer adaptability for \ncustom solutions at the edge, while ASICs offer top-\ntier performance and efficiency for specific tasks. As \nthe complexity of AI increases, the search for faster, \nmore efficient hardware persists. By leveraging the \ncapabilities of specialized hardware, organizations can \nspearhead the forthcoming wave of AI innovation.\n —Generative AI (gen AI) opens the door to more applied \nAI. Gen AI adoption is not only increasing among \ncurious individuals but also catalyzing increased \nadoption of applied AI. We see organizations getting the \nmost impact from gen AI when they intertwine it with \napplied AI use cases. For instance, a digital-marketing \ncompany is using gen AI to create a variety of unique \nand engaging content for its customers. However, the \nreal magic happens when its applied AI systems analyze \nthe performance of the generated content, identifying \npatterns and trends in user engagement. This data \nis then used to inform the gen AI system, generating \ninsights to produce more effective content in the future. \nIn this way, gen AI is being informed by real-world \ndata and feedback.

The \ncompany used a multilayered neural network model, \ntrained on two years of plant data, to determine \noptimal plant operations—for example, set points \nin the control room to achieve maximum heat-rate \nefficiency for any combination of external factors, \nsuch as temperature and humidity. Once power \nengineering experts validated the models, they began \nto provide recommendations to operators every 30 \nminutes to enhance the plant’s heat-rate efficiency, \nhelping operators meet energy targets and improve \nplant reliability. This led to a 30 percent decrease \nin duct burner usage, annual fuel savings of about \n$175,000, and reduced carbon emissions, ensuring \nmore efficient, more reliable power. The insights were \nincorporated into a solution named the Heat Rate \nOptimizer (HRO), which was implemented across the \ncompany’s entire fleet, yielding $23 million in savings. \nVistra has since extended the HRO to 67 additional \npower generation units across 26 plants.\n7\n \nUnderlying technologies\nAI comprises several technologies that perform \ncognitive-like tasks.

The rise of generative AI (gen AI) has reshaped \nthe AI landscape, demanding a corresponding upgrade in \nMLOps capabilities to service its unique demands. This is \nthe newest field for novel developments in the industrializing \nML trend.

This is particularly evident in \nthe complex task of upgrading enterprise technology \narchitecture to integrate and manage models and \norchestrate interaction between ML models and other \napplications and data sources. Several integration \npatterns are emerging, including those that allow \nmodels to call APIs in response to user queries. \nRecent advancements in integration and orchestration \nframeworks, such as LangChain and LlamaIndex, \nhave greatly facilitated these developments. To \neffectively integrate these models, it’s essential for \nMLOps pipelines to incorporate specific performance \nmeasurement tools. For instance, they need to assess \na model’s ability to retrieve the correct information. \nCompanies such as Fiddler and Databricks are actively \ninvesting in this field. They offer performance tracking, \nvalidation, and orchestration, enabling companies to \nmonitor their live operations effectively. This ensures  \nthe smooth facilitation of their ML applications,  \nfurther emphasizing the importance of monitoring  \nand orchestration in the successful implementation  \nof MLOps.\n —The use of prebuilt solutions and APIs is on the rise. In \nrecent years, there has been a significant surge in the \navailability of machine learning APIs and preconfigured \nsolutions, partly due to the explosive growth of gen \nAI. Accessed predominantly through APIs, gen AI \ntechnologies—encompassing advanced tools such \nas computer vision libraries and pretrained image \nrecognition models—have profoundly reshaped the ML \ndevelopment landscape. As these APIs gain popularity \nand continue to evolve, they are progressively assuming \nresponsibilities that were once the purview of ML \nengineers, such as data preprocessing and model \ntraining on predefined data sets. As gen AI continues \nto evolve, its impact on the field is expected to expand, \nmaking it a pivotal driver of industrializing  \nML technologies.\n —MLOps is important to gen AI from the get-go. It is \nincreasingly recognized that gen AI, including large \nlanguage models, should not be viewed as separate from \nthe ML ecosystem. Instead, there is a call to broaden \nthe scope of MLOps to incorporate gen AI. MLOps is \ncrucial in developing, deploying, and maintaining gen \nAI solutions, allowing ML algorithms to be dispatched \nquickly and effectively. By standardizing processes, \nenabling version control and tracking, and integrating \nshared metrics and monitoring, MLOps breaks down \norganizational silos and fosters close collaboration \nbetween data scientists, ML engineers, and operations \nteams and thus is pivotal in the end-to-end life cycle  \nof gen AI.\n‘The past several years have yielded huge advances in the \nmathematics of machine learning, but the tasks of making \nthat math really useful have lagged. MLOps—the way that the \nmath gets made useful—is finally catching up. The tools and \nprocesses are beginning to mature, but we still need additional \ntalent and skills to reap the benefits of machine learning.’ \n– Douglas Merrill, partner, Southern California\n26Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nJob postings by title, 2019–23, thousands\nDemand\nIndustrializing machine learning\nTalent and labor markets\nJob postings for roles related to industrializing ML decreased by 36 percent compared with 2022 levels, \nsignicantly greater than the 26 percent average decrease across all technology trends.

The year 2023 saw a significant rise in AI-powered \ntools, building on previous years’ advancements in software \ndevelopment and DevOps automation (for example, continuous \nintegration, continuous delivery, infrastructure as code, and \nimproved integrated development environments). These \ninnovations are revolutionizing how engineers operate throughout \nthe entire software development life cycle (SDLC), from planning \nand testing to deployment and maintenance. These technological \nbreakthroughs are not only enhancing the capabilities of \nengineers but also opening doors for less technical professionals \nto participate in application development as complex tasks are \nsimplified and accelerated. \nWhile the path to wide-scale adoption may take more time—\nbecause of obstacles such as integration challenges, lack of \nclear measurement metrics for developer productivity, and need \nfor large-scale retraining of developers and test engineers—an \nincrease in the adoption of AI-powered software development \ntools is promising. Early adopters are already experiencing \nproductivity boosts, laying the groundwork for more widespread \nadoption in the near future. This year promises even more \ngroundbreaking possibilities as maturing technologies like user-\nfriendly low-code platforms, AI assistants throughout the SDLC, \nintegration with gen-AI-enabled product management tools, and \nscalable cloud architectures converge, leading to democratized \ndevelopment, hyperefficiency, and exceptional adaptability.\nTalent demand Ratio\nof skilled people\nto job vacancies\nEquity investment \nPrivate- and public- \nmarket capital raises for \nrelevant technologies\nPatents Patent\n\u0006lings for technologies \nrelated to trend\nNews Press reports \nfeaturing trend-\nrelated phrases\nSearches Search \nengine queries for \nterms related to\ntrend\nResearch Scienti\u0006c \npublications on topics \nassociated with trend\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nNews\nTalent demand\nResearch\nSearches\n1.0\nPatents\nEquity\ninvestment\nScoring the trend\nBUILDING THE DIGITAL FUTURE\nScore by vector (0 = lower; 1 = higher)\nNext-generation\nsoftware development\nA large uptick in searches, publications, patents, and \ntalent demand between 2019 and 2023 clearly signals \nthat both institutions and enterprises are seeing \nlong-term potential in the evolution of next-generation \nsoftware development tools.

The software development industry \nhas witnessed a significant turning point in the past \nyear with the release of new versions of advanced \nAI-powered tools that are transforming the landscape. \nUnlike their static and off-the-shelf predecessors, \nthese new versions have moved beyond the proof-\nof-concept phase and now offer a higher degree of \nadaptability and customization, catering to the specific \nneeds of individual projects. This shift is resulting in a \nwider application of these tools. For instance, Tabnine, \nan AI-powered auto-completion tool, has improved its \nability to understand the context of developers’ code, \nleading to more accurate and relevant code completions. \nDevelopers can now create and share custom code \ntemplates within Tabnine, allowing them to automate \nrepetitive tasks specific to their projects or coding style, \nthereby increasing the tool’s applicability on a larger \nscale.\n1 \n —There is a growing trend toward more integrated \ndevelopment platforms. Companies are moving \naway from a multitude of disparate tools and, instead, \nadopting a smaller number of robust or better-integrated \nsolutions that offer a wide range of functionalities \nthroughout the development life cycle. This shift \nprovides several advantages, including streamlined \nworkflows that lead to improved collaboration, reduced \ncontext switching, and enhanced data visibility. \nHowever, catering to diverse use cases within the \norganization requires a careful selection of tools with \nrobust capabilities and flexibility.\n —The talent landscape will undergo changes. The \navailability of advanced underlying technologies, such as \ngen AI, is enabling software engineers to reallocate their \ntime from tasks such as pure code generation to tasks \nsuch as architecture design and problem solving. This \nchange is not only causing a strong mindset shift among \nengineers but also influencing how companies approach \ntalent selection, upskilling, and onboarding. The focus \nis no longer solely on the coding skills of potential \ncandidates. Instead, companies are investing in defining \na differentiated upskilling strategy to retain and develop \ntalent and are now also assessing how effectively \ncandidates can utilize and adapt to these advanced tools \nin their day-to-day tasks. \n —The focus on compliance and trust is increasing. The \nsoftware development industry is experiencing a \nsignificant shift toward compliance and trust in response \nto growing concerns about legal and security risks \nassociated with software tools. This past year has seen \ngrowing attention to compliance-focused tools like \nSonarQube, which provide features like code tagging, \nlabeling, and detection to improve transparency and \naccountability. Developers are also choosing tools with \nguaranteed indemnity to mitigate potential legal risks \nassociated with code generated or analyzed by the tool. \nBy prioritizing compliance and safety, the industry can \nimprove the quality and reliability of their software while \nalso reducing the risk of legal and security issues.\n1\n  “Tabnine + Pieces for Developers is a win-win for your workflow,” Pieces for Developers, May 3, 2023.\n‘These new-generation tools are now guaranteeing indemnity \nfor use, with the ability to detect, tag, and label code.

These are self-contained, \nindependently deployable pieces of code that can be \ncoupled to form larger applications.\n —AI-based testing. Next-generation software can use AI \nto automate unit and performance testing to reduce the \namount of time developers spend on this task.\n —Automated code review. These applications use AI  \nor predefined rules that enable users to check  \nsource code.\nKey uncertainties\nThe major uncertainties affecting next-generation software \ndevelopment include the following:\n —Relying on automated testing and reviews without \nhaving humans check the work can lead to increased \nerrors in software and erosion of user trust.\n —The growth in the use of low- and no-code tools by \nnondevelopers could be limited because experienced \ndevelopers are needed to monitor and debug \napplications. \n —Comprehensive monitoring and version control could \nbecome more difficult due to uncoordinated changes \nand upgrades from multiple vendors.\n —Quality and security remain concerns with code \ngenerated by AI pair programmers, particularly if they \nare not regularly updated with the latest standards or are \nnot trained on clean, fast code.\n —Addressing intellectual property, legal liability, and \npotential regulations surrounding gen-AI-generated \ncode is essential for responsible development and \ndeployment.\n —APIs add an extra layer of potential security \nvulnerabilities that can be exploited, and their \ncustomization can be a challenging task requiring \nsubstantial time and effort.\nBig questions about the future\nCompanies and leaders may want to consider a few \nquestions when moving forward with next-generation \nsoftware development:\n —To what extent will the development of AI-generated \ncode affect the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities, as \nwell as number, of software engineers?\n —To what extent might no-code tech used by amateur \ndevelopers reduce the demand for fully trained software \ndevelopment professionals?\n —From a cultural standpoint, will teams—both developers \nand nondevelopers—embrace or resist changes in ways \nof working? \n —What intellectual property issues might affect \nAI-generated code?\n —To what extent will business units take responsibility for \nthe health of applications, or will accountability continue \nto rest with a shared IT function?\n —Will organizations invest in the retraining needed \nto enable their software teams to adapt to the fast-\nchanging domain?\n —How do organizations upskill engineers to know what \ngood outputs from AI-enabled tools look like?\n35Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nDigital trust and cybersecurity\nThe trend—and why it matters\nDigital trust and cybersecurity enable organizations to manage \ntechnology and data risks, accelerate innovation, and protect \nassets. Moreover, building trust in data and technology \ngovernance can enhance organizational performance and improve \ncustomer relationships. In this trend, we include technologies that \nenhance trust (for instance, digital identity and privacy-enhancing \ntechnologies), cybersecurity capabilities (such as identity and \naccess management), and Web3 (such as blockchain). \nThe importance of digital trust and cybersecurity is increasing \nas organizations adopt emerging and maturing technologies \nwithin their enterprises (for example, cloud and edge computing, \napplied AI, and next-generation software development).\n1\n While \nthe adoption of these emerging technologies comes with exciting \nnew benefits, it also exposes organizations to cybersecurity and \nother risks, increasing the need for digital-trust technologies. The \nadoption of digital trust and cybersecurity, however, has been \naffected by a range of factors, including integration challenges, \norganizational silos, talent shortages, and its limited consideration \nas a critical component of value propositions. Capturing the full \nbenefit of digital trust and cybersecurity will require top-down \nleadership and deliberate changes to multiple spheres of activity, \nfrom strategy and technology to enterprise capabilities.\nTalent demand Ratio\nof skilled people\nto job vacancies\nEquity investment \nPrivate- and public- \nmarket capital raises for \nrelevant technologies\nPatents Patent\n\u0006lings for technologies \nrelated to trend\nNews Press reports \nfeaturing trend-\nrelated phrases\nSearches Search \nengine queries for \nterms related to\ntrend\nResearch Scienti\u0006c \npublications on topics \nassociated with trend\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nNews\nTalent demand\nResearch\nSearches\n0.5\nPatents\nEquity\ninvestment\nScoring the trend\nBUILDING THE DIGITAL FUTURE\nScore by vector (0 = lower; 1 = higher)\nDigital trust\nand cybersecurity\nThe digital trust and cybersecurity market has \nexperienced high growth over the recent years: the \ncybersecurity market growth rate in 2021 was 12.4 \npercent.¹  But, as with other trends aected by the \nmacroeconomic slowdown, the digital trust and \ncybersecurity trend took a hit in 2023, compared with \n2022, across dimensions such as investment and \ntalent demand.

The rise of generative AI (gen AI) has sparked \ninnovation across industries while also heightening the \nfocus on managing its associated risks. Key concerns \ninclude fairness and bias, as gen AI can perpetuate \nexisting biases embedded in training data. To counter \nthese concerns, companies like IBM are creating \nfairness tool kits to identify and remove bias within AI \nmodels during the development process. Privacy issues \narise as a result of gen AI’s ability to create deepfakes, \nprompting research into watermarking AI-generated \ncontent. The potential misuse of gen AI for cyberattacks \nunderscores the importance of robust AI security \nframeworks. Intellectual property (IP) rights over gen \nAI’s creative output remain unclear, and challenges \naround the explainability of gen AI’s outputs hinder trust. \nPresident Biden’s executive order on gen AI, calling \nfor research into these risks and the development of \ntrustworthy AI standards, and the recently adopted  \nEU AI Act create pressure for responsible deployment \nand will likely lead to the adoption of new tools, such as  \nthose coming from emerging players like Credo AI  \nand Holistic AI.\n —Cybercriminals and threats are evolving at a rapid rate. \nThreat actors, including cybercriminals and state-\nsponsored groups, are becoming more sophisticated. \nTheir attacks exploit new vulnerabilities (for example, \nintricate ransomware that is debilitating power grids) \nand aim for maximum disruption (for example, targeting \nindustrial control systems). Unfortunately, current \nsecurity systems and company readiness are often \nnot at the level needed to deal with this increased \ncybersecurity risk.\n —New buyers are emerging outside of the CISO role. \nResponsibility for cybersecurity is expanding beyond the \noffice of the chief information security officer (CISO), with \ncyber spend now increasingly coming from nonsecurity \nbusiness functions such as product and engineering.\n2\n  \nConsequently, cybersecurity providers must adapt \ntheir strategies to use cases with a wide range of \nstakeholders, including and stretching beyond the CISO \noffice. Improving cybersecurity maturity, increasing \nefficiency, and possibly increasing the use of AI-enabled \nautomation remain key growth drivers.\n —The ongoing debate between cybersecurity platforms \nand best-of-breed solutions is evolving. Cybersecurity \nplatforms offer a unified environment, simplifying \nmanagement but potentially compromising on \nfunctionality. Conversely, best-of-breed solutions offer \nspecialized tools but can struggle with data integration \nand user experience. We see a shift as the lines \nbetween platforms and best-of-breed solutions are \nblurring, with platforms becoming more modular and \nintegrating best-in-class security tools. The market is at \nan inflection point in the “best of breed” versus “best of \nsuite” debate: customers have not reached a consensus \non a preference in any segment. Smaller companies \nmight favor the simplicity of platforms, while larger ones \nmay value the customization offered by best-of-breed \nsolutions. The best path lies in balancing comprehensive \nsecurity with manageable complexity while considering \nthe company’s security maturity, IT staff skills, and \ngrowth prospects.\n —Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are sparking mainstream \ninterest. After a period marked by regulatory challenges \nfor crypto exchanges, multiple Bitcoin exchange-\ntraded funds (ETFs) have been approved. This has \neffectively lowered the entry barrier, opening up the \nworld of cryptocurrencies to a wider audience. In \naddition to Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs are also gaining \ntraction. Several Ethereum ETFs are currently awaiting \napproval, indicating a growing interest in diversifying \ncryptocurrency investments. While these developments \nhave significantly influenced the digital-asset market, it \nremains volatile.\n —Blockchain companies are moving from piloting to \nat-scale deployment of tokenized financial assets. \nTokenization, the process of creating a unique digital \nrepresentation of an asset on a blockchain network, \nhas started to scale after many years of promise \nand experimentation. The benefits—including \nprogrammability, composability, and enhanced \ntransparency—can empower financial institutions to \ncapture operational efficiencies, increase liquidity, and \ncreate new revenue opportunities through innovative \nuse cases. However, as infrastructure players pivot away \nfrom proofs of concept to robust at-scale solutions, \nmany opportunities and challenges remain to reimagine \nthe future of financial services. \n2\n A recent McKinsey survey on cyber market customers (n = 200) asked respondents, “In your best estimation, how much of your cybersecurity spend comes \nfrom outside of your CISO organization?

About 30 percent of survey respondents \nreported that they had either fully scaled or were scaling \ndigital trust and cybersecurity, and more than 60 percent \nmentioned they had invested in it. Financial-services \ncompanies, in particular, have adopted this trend, driven by \na need to combat an increasing range of threats and meet \nregulatory requirements.  \nTelecommunications, media, and technology companies \nare also at the forefront of adopting digital trust and \ncybersecurity. This is likely because they are leading the way \nin enhancing security measures, particularly in the realm of \nAI, and developing effective tools to address the constantly \nevolving threat landscape.\nCompanies of any size need to consider how to optimize \ntheir defenses as cyberthreats and regulatory and customer \npressures increase.\nAdoption dimensions\nThe adoption trajectory for advanced technologies \nvaries for each technology and each use case within that \ntechnology. Advancements along the following dimensions \ncould enable the next level of adoption for digital-trust and \ncybersecurity technologies:\n —new digital identity systems integrated and scaled into \nexisting personal-identification processes \n —enhanced integration of advanced technologies into \nexisting cybersecurity frameworks, including upgrading \nmidmarket companies’ defenses\n —strong protection mechanisms to ensure user privacy \nand control of personal data \n —improved government and public perception of the \nbenefits and risks of digital identities \n —security capabilities to meet varying regulatory \nrequirements, ensuring compliance and fostering trust \n —innovative applications with tangible real-world \nimplications for Web3 to continue expansion beyond \ndecentralized finance as practical applications emerge \nacross various sectors—for example, the decentralized \nphysical infrastructure network (DePIN), still in its early \nstages, which aims to enable cell phones to function on a \ndecentralized network\nIn real life  \nReal-world examples involving the use of digital trust and \ncybersecurity include the following:\n —Salesforce built its Einstein Trust Layer specifically to \naddress security concerns about using large language \nmodels (LLMs) within the Salesforce platform. This \ninnovative system acts as a secure intermediary for \nSalesforce users interacting with LLMs. The Einstein \nTrust Layer ensures data confidentiality and privacy by \nmasking personally identifiable information (PII) before \nit is used as input for the LLM and by adhering to a zero-\nretention architecture, meaning none of the Salesforce \ndata is stored outside the platform or used to train \nthe LLM itself. Additionally, the Trust Layer monitors \noutputs for inappropriate content and streamlines \ncommunication between the user and the LLM.\n —Cisco created a customer-facing trust portal called \nthe Cisco Trust Portal. This self-service tool provides \ncustomers with on-demand access to a wide range of \ndocuments related to security, trust, data protection, and \nprivacy compliance. The purpose of the Trust Portal is to \nassist customers in gaining a deeper understanding of \nCisco’s security measures and evaluating the security of \nits offerings.\n‘Digital-trust technologies are the cornerstone of value \ncreation in the age of gen AI. By embedding robust \nsecurity, privacy, and ethical frameworks into AI systems, \norganizations not only protect their assets but also build \na foundation of trust that drives innovation, enhances \ncustomer loyalty, and unlocks new opportunities for \nsustainable growth.’ \n– Liz Grennan, partner, Stamford\n39Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\n —Skyflow offers a platform called the Skyflow Data \nPrivacy Vault, designed to help companies manage, \nprotect, and utilize sensitive data while ensuring \ncompliance and privacy.\n3\n It acts as a secure central hub \nfor sensitive data, isolating it from other systems and \nencrypting it with advanced techniques. Despite strong \nsecurity, Skyflow’s secure APIs still allow users to utilize \nthis data for workflows, sharing, or analysis—all without \never decrypting the original information.\n —Franklin Templeton launched the Franklin OnChain \nU.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX), the first \nUS-registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain \nto process transactions and record share ownership. \nToward the end of March 2024, it had exceeded \n$330 million in assets under management. The fund \nis primarily issued on the Stellar public blockchain \nand Polygon. Franklin Templeton has also announced \nplans to issue tokens on other blockchains, including \nAvalanche and Aptos.\n4\n —French banking giant Société Générale completed its \nfirst tokenized green-bond issuance on the Ethereum \nnetwork, reflecting the growing interest in real-\nworld-asset tokenization among traditional financial \ninstitutions. The bank’s digital-asset-focused division, \nSG-FORGE, registered the issuance of digital green-\nbond tokens valued at €10 million ($10.8 million). \nThese security tokens were purchased by two major \ninstitutional investors, AXA Investment Managers and \nGenerali Investments, through a private placement.\n —Citibank has developed a token service using blockchain \ntechnology to offer digital-asset solutions for its \ninstitutional clients.\n5\n The new service, called Citi Token \nServices, converts clients’ deposits into digital tokens, \nfacilitating immediate cross-border payments, liquidity, \nand automated trade finance solutions around the \nclock at virtually no cost. As an integral part of the \nbank’s Treasury & Trade Solutions, Citi Token Services \naims to integrate these tokenized deposits into Citi’s \nglobal network, thereby strengthening its core cash \nmanagement and trade finance functions.\nUnderlying technologies\nDigital-trust and cybersecurity technologies include the \nfollowing:\n —Zero-trust architecture. This IT security design concept \nassumes an organization’s network is compromised by \ndefault and, therefore, enforces access decisions for \nevery interaction with every entity.\n —Digital identity. An identity consists of all the digital \ninformation that characterizes and distinguishes an \nindividual or an entity. With self-sovereign identity, \nusers control which identifying information to share \nand with whom. Passwordless identity allows users to \nverify and authenticate themselves not with traditional \nalphanumeric passwords but with alternatives such as \nbiometrics, devices and applications, and documents. \nBusinesses are developing “converged identity” \nsolutions, which bring together different dimensions of \nidentity into a single platform, enabling, for example, \ncontinuity as a person shifts from employee to business \npartner to customer. \n —Privacy engineering. This practice governs the \nimplementation, operations, and maintenance of privacy \nby design. It focuses on the strategic reduction of \nprivacy risks, enabling purposeful decision making about \nresource allocation and effective implementation of \nprivacy controls in information systems.\n —Explainable AI. This AI model covers methods and \napproaches that increase the transparency and \ninterpretability of the inputs, weightings, and reasoning \nof machine learning algorithms, thus enhancing trust and \nconfidence in them.\n —Technology resilience. Technology resilience is the sum \nof practices and technical foundations necessary to \narchitect, deploy, and operate technology safely across \nan enterprise environment. It includes components such \nas immutable backup and self-healing networks. Such \ncapabilities help organizations identify and overcome \nchallenges such as latency, outages, or compromise \nand have the dual goal of reducing the likelihood of \ntechnology risk events and enabling faster recovery if a \ntechnology risk event does occur.\n3\n Manish Ahluwalia, “What is a data privacy vault?,” Skyflow, June 23, 2022.\n4\n “What is Web3?,” McKinsey, October 10, 2023.\n5\n “Citi develops new digital asset capabilities for institutional clients,” Citibank press release, September 18, 2023. \n40Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\n —Blockchain. This is a digitally distributed, decentralized \nledger that exists across a computer network and \nfacilitates the recording of transactions.\n —Smart contracts. Established in immutable code on a \nblockchain, these software programs are automatically \nexecuted when specified conditions (such as terms \nagreed on by a buyer and seller) are met.\n —Digital assets and tokens. These digitally native \nintangible items include native cryptocurrencies, \ngovernance tokens, stablecoins, nonfungible tokens \n(NFTs), and tokenized real-world and financial assets, \nincluding cash.\n —Decentralized applications. These applications operate \non peer-to-peer networks, removing dependence \non centralized servers. They leverage blockchain \ntechnology for data storage and security, often utilizing \ncryptocurrencies for transactions and user engagement.\nKey uncertainties \nThe major uncertainties affecting digital trust and \ncybersecurity include the following:\n —Implementation complexity is significant, given resource \nrequirements, talent scarcity, inadequate funding, lack \nof shared taxonomies and aligned risk frameworks, \ncoordination challenges across multiple parties, and \nrequired shifts in organizational norms and practices \nneeded to achieve effective deployments.\n —Compatibility challenges will be encountered when \nupdating or migrating technologies and integrating them \nwith legacy systems or with an abundance of fragmented \npoint solutions.\n —Lack of standardization and widely accepted best \npractices for how or when to use trust architecture \ntechniques across industries will continue to be \na challenge. Additionally, differences in national \ncybersecurity regulations necessitate changes to local \ncompany policies. \n —Tensions between privacy and fairness or privacy and \nsafety can arise. An example might be tension between \nthe avoidance of an excessive collection of demographic \ndata and the need for that data to assess and mitigate \nbias or spot harms against minors.\n —Geopolitical tensions may lead to increased cyber \nrisk. Organizations should adopt comprehensive and \nadaptive cybersecurity strategies to mitigate these \nrisks and ensure resilience when navigating geopolitical \nuncertainty.\n —Regulatory landscapes for blockchain and tokenization \nremain fragmented and under development across \nvarious jurisdictions, posing significant challenges for \ncompliance. While some regions have begun to establish \ncomprehensive frameworks, such as the EU’s Markets in \nCrypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, the United States and \nother countries are still navigating through legislative \nprocesses with bills like the Blockchain Regulatory \nCertainty Act. Therefore, it is wise to continuously \nmonitor these evolving regulations to adapt and ensure \ncompliance.\n6\n \n —The path to explainability is unclear. There is no one-\nsize-fits-all approach to open up the black box of \nlarge AI models to provide meaningful explanation for \noutputs. These need to be tailored to context and data. \nHowever, more efficient tooling and new approaches to \nexplainability create hope for future improvement.\n —Businesses have doubts about data usage. Many \ncompanies are worried about their confidential data \nbeing used to train LLMs, leading to data and IP leakage. \nThis can cause them to default to more expensive \nsolutions requiring in-house training. Meanwhile, to \nalleviate these fears, vendors are offering stronger \ncommitments to data protection, and some are offering \nvarious forms of indemnity against IP claims.\n6\n “Tokenization: A digital-asset déjà vu,” McKinsey, August 15, 2023.\n‘In a world where information is digital, connected, \nand widely accessible, cybersecurity forms the very \nbedrock of trust through which competitive advantage \ncan be accelerated.

Private-\nnetwork adoption, specifically with 5G, has increased, \nwith industries such as manufacturing, oil and gas, \nand mining seeking out the potential latency and \nsecurity benefits. While the pace of adoption is modest, \nenterprises are beginning to pilot and subsequently \nimplement this technology, with telecom players, OEMs, \nand cloud providers also building out the supporting \ninfrastructure. \n —6G continues to develop, but some questions remain. \nProgress is being made through research with public–\nprivate partnerships, regulatory preparation, and \nstandardization, but there are outstanding questions \nabout the road to monetization and adoption. It is still \nunclear whether the value added by 6G to certain \napplications will outweigh the associated costs and \nwhether telecom companies will be able to successfully \nmonetize this new innovation. In any case, securing \nexternal investments, critical infrastructure, and the \nright talent mix will be essential to navigating toward a \n6G future. Another source of uncertainty is that adoption \nspeed will largely depend on spectrum cost and sharing \nregulation.\n —Adoption of xRAN in mobile networks is emerging. In \n2023, large partnerships formed to build out radio-\naccess-networks (xRAN) infrastructure. The technology \nmakes use of the development of xRAN—that is, open \ninterfaces (oRAN), virtualization of network functions \n(vRAN), and centralization of control (cRAN)—to \nenhance the flexibility and interoperability in the design \nand operation of wireless networks.\n3\n Both vRAN \nand oRAN enable a potential shift away from tightly \nintegrated hardware and software components from \nsingle vendors to open interfaces and standardization \nof components, increasing flexibility to select services \nfrom a wider range of vendors.\n —Deployment of LEO satellite constellations is advancing. \nLow-Earth orbit (LEO) is the orbit range for satellites \nthat is closest to Earth.

This could potentially result from the expansion of networks into the greater technology \necosystem, allowing telecom players to tap into a larger talent pool for network engineers shared with other \ntraditional tech companies. \n46Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nAdoption developments across the globe\nAdvanced connectivity is one of the top five most adopted \ntrends and is driven by the growth of technologies such \nas the Internet of Things (IoT), which rely on advanced-\nconnectivity capabilities. \nOutside of the technology, media, and telecommunications \nsector, financial-services and energy and materials \ncompanies have emerged as leaders in the adoption of \nadvanced-connectivity tools, with many companies in \nthese industries reporting that they are scaling or fully \nimplementing the technology.\nAdoption dimensions\nThe adoption trajectory of advanced technologies, such as \n5G private networks, varies for each technology and each \nuse case within that technology. Advancements along the \nfollowing dimensions could enable reaching the next level  \nof adoption:\n —additional software applications to promote \ninteroperability with existing enterprise infrastructure \n(for example, digital twins leveraging 5G capabilities)\n —clarification of spectrum licensing regulation to advance \nadoption for bands reserved for private networks in \nhigh-traffic areas\n —reduction in installation costs and proliferation of 5G \nend points to allow small and medium-size enterprises to \nimplement the technology feasibly\n —enterprise-level holistic vision of all the use cases that \nrequire 5G over other connectivity technologies (such \nas Wi-Fi), along with investment in scaling the use cases \nwith demonstrated proof of concept\nIn real life \nReal-world examples involving advanced connectivity \ninclude the following:\n —In January 2024, AT&T, Google, and Vodafone were \ninvolved in a strategic $155 million investment in AST \nSpaceMobile. The investment is intended to fund a \n“direct-to-smartphone connectivity constellation” that \nwill allow wireless users to stay connected outside of cell \ntower coverage.\n5\n  \n —Verizon partnered with Allegiant Stadium, host of \n2024’s Super Bowl, to provide private 5G networks for \ncoach-to-coach communications and 5G nodes for \nspectators. The company estimated that about half \nof the approximately 61,000 spectators were Verizon \ncustomers. They used 52 terabytes of data, up  \n10 percent from the prior year.\n6\n  \n —AT&T announced that it will begin deploying oRAN in \ncollaboration with Ericsson, aiming at a commercial-\nscale deployment of the technology to increase the \ninteroperability of its infrastructure. AT&T plans to spend \napproximately $14 billion over the five-year contract with \nEricsson, with 70 percent of its wireless network traffic \nto pass over open platforms by 2026.\n7\n  \nUnderlying technologies\nThe noteworthy technologies in advanced connectivity \ninclude the following:\n —Optical fiber. Physical strands of glass provide the most \nreliable high-throughput, low-latency connectivity.\n —Low-power wide area networks. These wireless \nnetworks (for example, narrowband IoT, LoRa, and \nSigfox) can cover large areas more efficiently while being \nenergy efficient at the end points, focused particularly \non providing connectivity for Internet of Things. \n —Wi-Fi 6 and 7. Next-generation Wi-Fi offers higher \nthroughput, more controllable quality of service, and a \ncellular-like level of security.\n —5G and 6G cellular. These next-generation cellular \ntechnologies provide high-bandwidth, low-latency \nconnectivity services with access to higher-spectrum \nfrequency bands capable of handling a massive \namount of connected end points, as well as low-power \nconnectivity suitable for IoT.\n —High-altitude platform systems (HAPS). These are radio \nstations located at a fixed point 20 to 50 kilometers \nabove Earth. HAPS can be deployed on lightweight \naircraft to provide flexible capacity and access in  \nremote locations.\n —Direct-to-handset satellite connectivity. Partnerships \nbetween telecom companies and satellite players allow \ndirect access from phone to satellite, expanding network \ncoverage beyond the reach of traditional cellular towers.\n8\n \n5\n Jason Rainbow, “Google and AT&T join $155 million AST SpaceMobile investment,” SpaceNews, January 19, 2024. \n6\n “Verizon customers used 52.34 TB of data in and around Allegiant Stadium for Super Bowl LVIII,” Verizon press release, February 12, 2024.\n7\n “AT&T to accelerate open and interoperable radio access networks (RAN) in the United States through new collaboration with Ericsson,” AT&T press release, \nDecember 4, 2023.\n8\n Ivan Suarez and Calil Queiroz, “The coming era of satellite direct-to-handset connectivity,” Via Satellite, November 28, 2022.\n47Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\n —Internet of Things.

A constellation of satellites \nin orbits at relatively low altitudes above Earth’s surface \ncan enable connecting remote or inaccessible locations \nwith high-speed internet, in addition to other use cases, \nsuch as satellite imaging.\nKey uncertainties \nKey uncertainties of advanced-connectivity adoption vary \nby technology:\n —Telco profitability is being strained as a result of \ncompetitive pricing, the commoditization of connectivity, \nchallenges in monetizing better network quality, and the \nincreasing traffic and deployment costs, all of which have \nled to challenging ROI. While advanced connectivity \nundoubtedly creates value, the connectivity layer does \nnot currently capture enough to sustain investment.\n —The availability of mature use cases, such as 5G-enabled \nrobotics and gaming on the go, caters to both industrial \nverticals and consumers requiring higher-service-level \nagreements, such as high throughput or low latency.\n —Ecosystem maturity plays a critical role in the adoption \nof IoT, whose uptake has been slower than expected as a \nresult of a highly fragmented market, security concerns, \ninteroperability, complex deployments involving a vast \nassortment of players, and a lack of standardization. \nFor 5G and 6G, telecom operators’ monetization \nstruggles might affect their ability to build the necessary \ninfrastructure for at-scale rollouts globally. \n —Government involvement is still unfolding and will \nplay a role in regulations and funding for 5G and next-\ngeneration digital infrastructure. Currently, many \ngovernments are involved in the supply factors, while \ndeveloping demand-side use cases remains the \nexception.\nBig questions about the future\nCompanies and leaders may want to consider a few \nquestions when moving forward with advanced connectivity:\n —What fundamental shifts does the telecom industry need \nto make to improve profitability?\n —How will changes in the fiber market (for example, \nfinancing and delayering) affect network options for \ncustomers? Will 5G be sufficiently monetized? \n —What are the expectations from various stakeholders for \nnext-generation wireless technologies?\n —What will 6G look like? What needs to happen \ntechnologically and financially for network equipment \nplayers, telecom companies, enterprises, and chip \nmanufacturers to invest in and monetize 6G?  \n —Will private-network adoption take off? What do \nindustrial verticals need to know about it to avoid \nmissing out on its benefits?\n —Will there be an oversupply of satellites as providers \nramp up LEO launches and benefit from technological \nadvancements?\n9\n \n‘Advanced connectivity enabled an array of industrial use \ncases and transformed the day-to-day lives of people across the \nglobe. Creating value for investors is something the telecom \nindustry was struggling with quite a bit, as a large share of \nextra profits is going to the tech players sitting on top of the \nadvanced telecom networks.’ \n– Zina Cole, partner, New York\n9\n Chris Daehnick, John Gang, and Ilan Rozenkopf, “Space launch: Are we heading for oversupply or a shortfall?,” McKinsey, April 17, 2023.\n48Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nImmersive-reality technologies\nThe trend—and why it matters\nImmersive-reality technologies allow users to experience \nan augmented form of our world or virtual worlds while \nuncovering a series of new use cases for consumers and \nenterprises alike.

The public cloud \nallows enterprises to host workloads remotely and scale \nthe consumption of computing and storage resources on \ndemand, resulting in better economies at scale, flexibility, \nand speed of deployment of applications. With edge \ncomputing, organizations can process data much closer \nto where the data originate, providing lower latency, \nlower data-transfer costs, and increased data privacy \ncompared with the cloud (while adhering to data residency \nlaws as well). Cloud and edge computing has amplified AI \ncapabilities for both training and inferencing on foundational \nmodels and will continue to be a major driver for the \nadoption of these technologies. Balancing workloads across \ncloud and edge (and the locations in between) will allow \nenterprises to optimize resourcing, latency, data privacy, and \nsecurity at scale and, in turn, unlock business value. \nTalent demand Ratio\nof skilled people\nto job vacancies\nEquity investment \nPrivate- and public- \nmarket capital raises for \nrelevant technologies\nPatents Patent\n\u0006lings for technologies \nrelated to trend\nNews Press reports \nfeaturing trend-\nrelated phrases\nSearches Search \nengine queries for \nterms related to\ntrend\nResearch Scienti\u0006c \npublications on topics \nassociated with trend\n0.2\n0.1\n0.3\nNews\nTalent demand\nResearch\nSearches\n0.4\nPatents\nEquity\ninvestment\nScoring the trend\nScore by vector (0 = lower; 1 = higher)\nCloud and edge\ncomputing\nInvestment scores have increased since 2019, with \nsigni\u0006cant funding during the peak years of 202022. \nOverall innovation scores (patents and publications) \nhave trended upward since 2019.

The rise of \nAI in 2023 resulted in a massive increase in cloud and \nedge usage, with a CAGR of approximately 30.9 percent \nexpected in the cloud AI market between 2023 and \n2030 and an estimated increase in cloud spend of about \n20.0 percent,\n1\n as companies train and fine-tune models \nand perform inferences. The need for extremely large \namounts of compute for AI model training has forced \nbusinesses that have not yet transitioned to the cloud to \ncommit to it for AI endeavors, since most on-premises \ndata centers cannot meet the compute requirements \nof AI workloads. Start-ups such as Lambda Labs\n2\n and \nCoreWeave\n3\n also took advantage of the AI boom to \ncompete with hyperscalers on providing graphics-\nprocessing-unit (GPU) services (“GPU as a service”) for \nenterprises that do not have access to GPU compute on \ntheir own. \n —Priority shifts to on-premises edge solutions. Some \norganizations are shifting focus from operating at \nthe network and operator edge (computing locations \nsituated at sites that are owned by a telecommunications \noperator, such as a central data office in a mobile \nnetwork) to on-premises edge solutions that are closer \nto the end user (such as an on-site data center) to \nminimize latency and data transmit times, while demand \nfor private network connectivity has driven customer \nadoption of edge-enabled use cases. A variety of \nenterprise locations are poised to take advantage of \non-premises edge; they include manufacturing plants, \nrestaurants, retail stores, and hospitals.\n —For some use cases, the shift from cloud to edge \ncomputing marks the next evolution of AI models. While \n2023 was mostly focused on training foundation models \nfor AI, companies are expected to begin performing \ninference at scale on their models in 2024. With low \nlatency taking priority when performing inference for \nsome use cases, some workloads will likely shift to \nthe edge as companies begin to put their models into \ncommercial use.\n —Companies diversify their GPU supply base. Nvidia’s \nwell-documented success in the GPU market throughout \n2023 has improved GPU access for customers, \nfrom hyperscalers to start-ups such as CoreWeave. \nCompanies of all sizes are considering additional \noptions for sourcing or building GPUs. For example, \nhyperscalers are exploring and actively working on \na collection of sources for their compute needs and \nhave started designing in-house hardware and chips. \nOther alternatives to Nvidia chips include chips from \nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel.\n4\n However, the \nability to interchange GPU chips is also affected by the \nsoftware that facilitates their utilization.

Most companies adopt cloud and edge computing \ntechnologies to increase the value of existing offerings, \nlower costs, better serve their customers, and optimize \nthe use of computer and storage resources. Companies \nin regions like Africa show a strong interest in adopting \ncloud but struggle with a lack of local data centers from \nhyperscalers, legacy infrastructure, and connectivity \nissues.\n5\n Cloud adoption in the Middle East is growing fast, \nwith significant investment in regional data centers.\n6\n   \nSome of the leading industries in adopting cloud \nand edge computing include technology, media, and \ntelecommunications; energy and materials; and financial \nservices.\nAdoption dimensions\nEnterprises are likely to seek improvements in latency, cost, \nand security, spurring the next level of adoption of edge \ncomputing technologies. Advancements along the following \ndimensions could enable the next level of adoption:\n —Scaled adoption of low-latency use cases (such as self-\ndriving cars and virtual reality headsets) or an increase \nin AI inferencing needs could lead to a shift from cloud \nto edge computing to improve latency for consumer and \nenterprise use cases and to process data much closer to \nwhere the data originate.\n —Enterprises could move computation from the cloud \nto the edge, potentially as a result, for example, of \nincreased data security requirements.\n —A reduction in the cost of edge connectivity makes it \nmore feasible for small and medium-size enterprises to \nmigrate relevant, expensive cloud workstreams to the \nedge.\nIn real life\nReal-world examples involving cloud and edge computing \ninclude the following:\n —McDonald’s and Google Cloud announced a multiyear \nglobal partnership to use edge computing for the \nrestaurant’s mobile app, self-service kiosks, and other \nmachinery.

IoT devices, such \nas sensors and video cameras, are used to collect and \nprocess data. These devices often come with basic \ncomputing and storage capabilities.\n —On-premise or “close to the action” edge. These are \ncomputing and storage resources deployed within the \npremises or a remote or mobile location where data are \nbeing generated.\n —Operator, network, and mobile edge computing \n(MEC). These are private or public computing and \nstorage resources deployed at the edge of a mobile or \nconverged-services provider’s network, typically one \nnetwork hop away from enterprise premises.\n —Metro edge. Data centers with smaller footprints (about \nthree megawatts) located in large metro areas augment \nthe public cloud with near-premises computing power \nand storage to provide lower latency and greater \navailability. \nKey uncertainties \nThe major uncertainties affecting cloud and edge computing \ninclude the following:\n —Scaling hurdles could arise as the number of edge nodes \nand devices grows, because edge computing does not \nbenefit from the same economies of scale as traditional \ncloud computing. \n —There is limited availability of talent and management \nbuy-in. Companies scaling cloud computing often face a \nshortage of in-house talent to implement cloud solutions \neffectively. This shortage poses challenges in identifying \nnew use cases tailored to the local context, such as \nthose specific to a retail store. Additionally, it hinders  \nthe scaling of cloud infrastructure. This challenge \nis further exacerbated if there is a lack of local \nmanagement buy-in.\n —Technical challenges make it difficult to maintain and \nscale cloud computing. The complexity of ML/AI models \nand the absence of readily deployable solutions pose \nsignificant challenges for companies seeking to build \ncloud-computing capabilities. Additionally, maintaining \nand managing edge hardware at scale can be tedious. \nFurthermore, current 5G MEC coverage is not yet \nextensive enough to support the scaling of use cases.\n —Other challenges include limited ROI visibility, an overall \nlonger path to returns for edge development, a lack \nof customer understanding of value-add use cases, \nlarge investment requirements for scaling from pilot \nto at-scale implementations, a complicated technical \nstack requirement (especially due to integration with the \nexisting tech landscape at most companies), and a lack \nof ready-to-deploy solutions.\n —Privacy in the cloud is still a concern for many \nenterprises. Some organizations are subject to strict \ndata privacy laws and are generally hesitant to make \na full migration to the cloud in the event of a breach or \ncyberattack. \nBig questions about the future\nCompanies and leaders may want to consider a few \nquestions when moving forward with cloud and edge \ncomputing:\n —Will flexibility and positioning in a business and \nregulatory sweet spot make edge more disruptive than \ncloud? Or will inhibitors such as lack of interoperability \nand commonality of standards in networking prevent \nedge from reaching its full potential?\n —Will hyperscale cloud providers be leaders in edge \ncomputing? And how will telecommunications \ncompanies with 5G-enabled MEC contend or partner \nwith hyperscalers?\n —How will rapidly evolving AI technology and, importantly, \naccompanying regulatory changes alter cloud and edge \nprovider business models?\n —How will specialized chips deployed both in data \ncenters and at the edge, such as AI inference or always-\non sensors, modify the competitive cloud and edge \nlandscape?\n —Will the increase in the number of storage and \nprocessing units lead to security vulnerabilities?\n —How will the transition to green infrastructure facilitate \nthe continued evolution of cloud and edge technology? \n —As sensor costs drop and their performance increases, \nhow will edge and cloud resources cope with growing \ndemand for data movement and AI-enabled analytics?\n —Will reduced connectivity costs drive more edge \nadoption?\n58Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nQuantum technologies\nThe trend—and why it matters\nQuantum technologies encompass three pillars: quantum \ncomputing, which not only will provide a speedup over \ncurrent computing systems for certain problems but also \ncould enable applications that are impossible to implement \non classical computers; quantum communication, which will \nbe critical for secure communication in the era of quantum \ncomputers; and quantum sensing, which provides higher \nsensitivity in more modalities than conventional sensors for \nspecific applications. The estimated full potential economic \nimpact of these technologies could be upward of roughly \n$0.9 trillion. While the actual quantum advantage for useful \napplications is still outstanding, we see promising research \nand experimentation within pioneering enterprises across \nindustries, including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, finance, \nautomotive, and aerospace. In 2023, we saw steady \nprogress on both the hardware and software fronts while \norganizations took more practical steps to ensure that their \ninfrastructure and security are ready for the technology. \nQuantum technology must overcome a series of technical \nhurdles to unlock its proposed benefits, which requires both \nprivate and public sector efforts.

This \nbreakthrough was followed recently by a collaboration \nbetween Microsoft and Quantinuum that produced four \nreliable qubits with an error rate below 0.01 percent.\n1 \n \nTeams at IBM\n2\n and Google’s Quantum AI\n3\n also made \nadvances throughout the year to push the boundaries \nof logical qubit storage, error rate per cycle, and error \nfrequency. These developments could serve as a \npromising stepping stone to necessary advancements \non the long road from focusing on record qubit numbers \nto achieving higher-quality, scalable qubits capable of \ndelivering meaningful results. Open hardware questions \nabout the efficacy of several qubit technologies are \ncurrently being explored, as each has its own benefits, \nchallenges, and optimal use cases. \n —Additional emphasis is being placed on building out \nthe full stack, including software and the integration \nof quantum into classical computing infrastructure. \nQuantum computers will be useful only for a small \nbut impactful set of problems; therefore, it will be \nimportant to think about which parts are calculated on a \nquantum-processing unit (QPU) versus other computer \narchitectures (for example, central processing units and \ngraphics processing units). Moreover, while there are \nmany technological hurdles to overcome, there has been \nadditional emphasis on building out the rest of the stack, \nfrom software development kits (such as IBM’s Qiskit) \nto testing and simulation of quantum algorithms (such \nas NVIDIA’s Quantum Cloud that was built on its open-\nsource CUDA platform in March 2024). \n —Strides have been made in information security \nbecause of the progress in quantum computing. Major \ntech players are ramping up their information security \nmeasures to reduce the risk of newer threats emerging \nfrom advancements in quantum computing. These are \ntermed “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks, where \ndata expected to have a long shelf life are captured \nand stored so they can be decrypted once quantum \ncomputers are powerful enough to crack today’s \nclassical public key encryption such as RSA or elliptic-\ncurve cryptography. For instance, various organizations \nare enhancing these classical public key encryptions \nwith postquantum-cryptography algorithms this year. \nThis allows these organizations to proactively mitigate \nthe risks of harvest now, decrypt later attacks with \ncurrently available classical tools ahead of potential \nadditional quantum-level protection—such as quantum \nkey distribution (QKD)—maturing and becoming \navailable. In December 2022, the Biden administration \nsigned into law the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity \nPreparedness Act, asking government agencies to \n“adopt technology that will protect against quantum \ncomputing attacks.”\n4\n Various intergovernmental \norganizations have also published policies and strategies \nto develop quantum technologies and prepare for \npotential quantum cyberattacks. \n —Start-up partnerships with conventional enterprises \ncontinue.

Given \nthe nascency of the technology, the number of graduates from quantum-speci c programs is low. As a result, \ntalent is sourced from the broader  elds of physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, chemistry, biochemis-\ntry, and chemical engineering.

However, the potential \nfor future quantum applications to be disruptive in select \nsectors and use cases has inspired several companies to \nengage in experimentation and pilots of different quantum \ntechnologies. These companies most commonly see \nthe ultimate goal of adopting quantum technologies as \nincreasing the value of existing offerings through better \noutcomes or products (for example, optimized portfolios \nand routing). \nThe finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, energy and \nmaterials (including chemicals), and telecommunications \nsectors have emerged as leaders in the adoption of \nquantum technologies, with more than roughly 40 percent \nof companies in these industries reporting that they are \nconducting experiments and pilots. These industries \ncover both shapers of quantum technologies (primarily \ntelecommunications and technology) and eventual end \nusers, with significant use cases across chemicals, \nfinance, and pharmaceuticals. Investments in quantum \ncommunications are driven by improvements in quantum-\nresistant cryptography and QKD to protect against future \ndecryption attacks by quantum computers, indicating a \nforward-looking approach to managing risk. \nAdoption dimensions\nThe adoption trajectory of advanced technologies varies for \neach technology and each use case within that technology. \nIf or when certain technical challenges are overcome, the \ndawn of quantum computers that are powerful enough \nto jeopardize current encryption provides a potentially \ndisruptive use case for quantum technologies. \nThe next level of adoption likely will involve companies \nleveraging quantum computers to significantly speed up \nthe solution to a set of valuable computational problems. \nAdditionally, companies will be motivated to enhance their \nencryption methods to include postquantum cryptography, \nensuring the protection of mission-critical and long-lived \ndigital data. \nAdvancements along the following dimensions could enable \nthe next level of adoption for quantum technologies:\n —to achieve further milestones suitable for large-scale \nfault-tolerant computing, an increased number of \nphysical qubits (that is, greater than 1,000) with lower \nerror rates (that is, 10\n–6\n or less) across several qubit \nplatforms (for example, superconducting and spin), along \nwith a road map to scalably interconnect qubits and \npossibly chips of qubits\n —to increase reliability, an increased number of logical, \nerror-corrected qubits (more than 50 to 100) \n —to secure data that retains its value over several years, \nimplementation of quantum-resistant cryptographic \nalgorithms (such as the four algorithms selected in 2022 \nby NIST: CRYSTALS-Kyber for key establishment and \nCRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS for digital \nsignatures)\n‘While the technology still faces challenges, significant \nadvancements have been made this year, especially in the \nfield of error correction.

EVs have been soaring in popularity \nfor several years and remain in high demand, despite \nthe recent slowing growth rate in certain regions.\n2\n \nEVs saw record sales in 2023, but manufacturers \nare seeing slowing consumer demand with lower \ngrowth projections for 2024, partially because of high \nprices and customer range anxiety. This is leaving \nautomakers with high EV inventory and forcing some to \ncut prices. The industry is now exploring how to make \nEVs meaningfully cheaper, particularly in the United \nStates and Europe. Even China, the world’s largest \nEV market, saw a slowdown in growth in 2023 that \ncoincided with reduced subsidies, touching off a price \nwar among domestic and foreign manufacturers.\n3\n The \nbattery industry continues to grow quickly because of \nheavy public and private investment in EV development. \nFor example, approximately 30 battery factories are \ncurrently planned, being constructed, or operational in \nthe United States alone; 13 of them are expected to open \nby 2025.\n —Robo-taxis navigate hurdles to achieve more \nwidespread commercial use. In August 2023, California \nregulators granted Waymo and Cruise permission to \noperate commercial robo-taxi services in San Francisco. \nHowever, following a series of safety incidents, Cruise \nhad its license revoked in October. Waymo continues its \ncommercial operations and has gained initial regulatory \napproval to expand within California and operate on \nhighways. China issued its first regulation on commercial \nAVs in December 2023, requiring a robo-taxi to remote-\noperator ratio of no more than 3:1.\n —Autonomous trucking reaches a pivotal moment as \ntesting begins. The year 2024 could be a watershed \none for autonomous trucking as companies begin \nlarger-scale on-the-road pilots. This is especially the \ncase in the United States, where demand has been \ndemonstrated, given that the trucking industry has \nbeen experiencing a shortage of drivers. Start-ups are \nbeginning commercial tests amid a mixed regulatory and \ninvestment environment. Aurora Innovation, a company \nspecializing in self-driving technology, began an on-the-\nroad pilot for commercial trucking on public highways \nbetween Houston and Dallas, with the goal of achieving \nfully autonomous trips by the end of 2024. Like the \nindustry for robo-taxis, the autonomous trucking sector \nfaces regulatory challenges related to safety concerns. \nHowever, interest remains strong.\n —Micromobility generally demonstrates resilience amid \nmarket consolidation. The micromobility sector has \nshown signs of steady growth and robust progress. \nLime, an e-scooter start-up, reported that for the first \ntime in 2022, it achieved profitability, which continued \ninto the first half of 2023. Users of micromobility \nare also wide ranging: a National Association of City \nTransportation Officials (NACTO) report indicates that \ncustomer segments of micromobility include commuters, \ntourists, and recreational users.\n4\n As the micromobility \nmarket progressed in 2023, it saw increased \nconsolidation in a bid to compete for funding and chase \nprofitability while also seeing postpandemic demand \nlevels for e-bikes decline in Europe.\n2\n Kersten Heineke, Philipp Kampshoff, and Timo Möller, “Spotlight on mobility trends,” McKinsey, March 12, 2024.\n3\n Selina Cheng, “Even the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market is slowing,” Wall Street Journal, February 18, 2024. \n4\n Andrew J.

In 2023, commercial drone deliveries saw a 14 \npercent increase from 2022, exceeding one million, and \ndrone delivery was the only future mobility technology \nto see a significant increase in funding.\n5\n This growth is \npartially due to favorable regulatory developments, such \nas the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granting \n120 waivers for beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) \noperations in 2023.\n6\n This includes approvals for drone \ndelivery players such as UPS Flight Forward, Wing \nAviation, and Zipline, representing a 65 percent increase \nin waivers from 2022. BVLOS operations allow drones \nto fly farther, with less costly oversight from nearby \npilots or visual observers, making expanded operations \npossible and the economics attractive.\n7\n \n —Funding for eVTOL aircraft experienced a slight \ndecline, but the potential for certification maintains \nmomentum. Funding for electric vertical takeoff and \nlanding (eVTOL) aircraft experienced a slight decline, \nwith eVTOL companies securing only about 50 percent \nof the funding they received in 2022. However, there is a \npositive outlook regarding potential certifications from \nregulatory bodies, which could reinvigorate the segment. \nTo support this growth, players are developing additional \ninfrastructure and manufacturing capabilities, including \ncharging facilities and landing sites.

For example, researchers \nat the University of Pennsylvania used an AI ranking \nalgorithm to reveal a previously unknown use for an \nexisting drug to treat a man with idiopathic multicentric \nCastleman disease (iMCD). While using the drug for this \npurpose has not yet been tested or approved at scale, its \nutilization in this case shows promising potential. \n —Advances in alternative-protein production continue \ndespite regulatory constraints. There has been renewed \ninterest in using technologies such as precision \nfermentation for producing alternative proteins. Having \nalready shown its viability, the technology, which is more \nsustainable than other forms of alternative-protein \nproduction, was granted safety approval in 2023, with \nNew Culture becoming the first company to achieve \na generally-recognized-as-safe (GRAS) grading for \nits animal-free protein. Cultivated meat, another form \nof alternative protein, has seen a mixed regulatory \nenvironment, however. Italy banned the production of \ncultivated meat in a bid to protect farmers, while the \nNetherlands became the first EU government to allow \ncultivated-meat tastings.\n2\n Julianna LeMieux, “The first CRISPR drug: Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ Casgevy wins U.K. approval for sickle cell disease,” Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology \nNews, November 16, 2023.\n‘We may look back at the past year as the point \nin time when gene editing became ‘everyday.’ \nWe now have approved cures for a well-known \nand widespread disease like sickle cell anemia \nand also have more consumer-oriented products, \nincluding purple tomatoes and glow-in-the-dark \nplants.

Job postings for research technicians, clinical-research coordinators, and medical \nengineers have remained largely consistent with prior years’ postings. However, the scientist role has experi-\nenced the most notable decline, possibly due to a surge in demand during the COVID19 pandemic, along with \na slowdown in investment in 2023.\nTalent availability, % share of postings requiring skill\nTalent availability, ratio of talent      to demand\nSkills availability\nWhile the supply of talent in molecular biology is high relative to demand, the supply of talent for more special-\nized areas—such as gene therapy and pharmaceuticals—is low.\n79Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nAdoption developments across the globe\nThe adoption of bioengineering technologies is low relative \nto other trends, as they are specific to certain industries and \nhave higher up-front capital investment needs as they reach \ncommercialization. The energy and materials industries \nhave seen a relatively high percentage of respondents \ndemonstrating that they have at least started experimenting \nwith bioengineering. This likely arises from its potential in \nboth well-established and nascent use cases—for example, \nimproved fermentation processes, bio routes to develop \nnovel materials with entirely new properties (for instance, \nalternatives to traditional leather), and broadening biofuels \nproduction to new feedstock sources. \nAdoption dimensions\nAdvancements along the following dimensions could enable \nthe next level of adoption:\n —continued investments in scientific research and \ndevelopment to support bioengineering innovation\n —an increase in regulatory approvals of bioengineering \ninnovations across most major economies (currently, \nmedicine developed through the use of CRISPR is \napproved in the European Union, the United Kingdom, \nand the United States)\n —improved public perception and broader social \nacceptance of the technologies \n —a complex infrastructure to support advanced \nbioengineering activities and the ability to scale \noperations and production to meet market demands\nIn real life \nThe following are real-world examples involving the future of \nbioengineering: \n —After acquiring Elixirgen Scientific in 2022, Ricoh, a \nJapanese digital-services company, sought to leverage \nits expertise in digital technologies and AI to create \nmore reliable disease models, leading to shorter drug \ndevelopment timelines and increased success rates. \nRicoh accordingly entered into a CRISPR/CRISPR-Cas9 \nlicense agreement with ERS Genomics for access to \ngene editing technology patents. The initiative aimed \nto accelerate personalized medicine, drug discovery \nresearch, and regenerative medicine.\n —Japan became the first country to approve a self-\namplifying mRNA vaccine that instructs the body on how \nto make more mRNA, as trial results have shown signs \nof an increased antibody response relative to traditional \nmRNA boosters. This advance could potentially allow \nfor lower effective dosages and a more resilient immune \nresponse, leading to fewer side effects and longer-\nlasting vaccines.\n —Tropic, an agricultural biotech company based in the \nUnited Kingdom, used CRISPR to genetically modify \nbananas so they stay fresh longer. Conventional \ntechniques for creating a genetically engineered \norganism involve the introduction of foreign DNA \nfrom other organisms, whereas CRISPR offers a \nmore targeted and precise approach to gene editing. \nThe Philippines Department of Agriculture has since \nclassified these bananas as non-GMO and approved \ntheir production. \n‘The momentum of progress in bioengineering \nremains strong, driven by breakthroughs in generative \nAI technologies that have unlocked new pathways \nfor innovation. The excitement surrounding these \nadvancements has already led to notable developments, \nparticularly in areas like protein engineering and drug \nrepurposing. We can only expect more, and faster, \nadoption of these technologies as biopharma and other \nindustries continue advancing their use of generative AI.’ \n– Erika Stanzl, partner, Zurich\n80Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\n —Insilico Medicine is evaluating its potentially first-in-class \nantifibrotic small-molecule inhibitor on lung function in \npatients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The \ncause of IPF, a progressive lung disease characterized \nby the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, is unknown, \nwhich makes it challenging to treat effectively. \nResearchers at Insilico Medicine used a combination \nof machine learning and generative AI to identify a \nnew therapeutic molecule to create a compound that \ndemonstrated antifibrotic properties. While this process \nusually takes five to eight years, the compound was able \nto progress to human trials in only 18 months. \n —Unilever announced that it will launch a version of \nits Breyers ice cream that consists of whey protein \nproduced by precision fermentation. The company has \npartnered with Perfect Day, a food-tech start-up, to \nproduce the whey protein to meet its sustainability goals.\n —Norfolk Plant Sciences released a genetically altered \npurple tomato with high levels of anthocyanins, a type \nof antioxidant shown to have anti-cancer and anti-\ninflammatory effects. The company began selling the \nseeds to farmers and gardeners alike, allowing regular \nconsumers to “grow biotech” in their own backyard.\nUnderlying technologies\nAdvancements in the following technologies will define the \nfuture of bioengineering:\n —Omics. Biological sciences ending in the suffix “-omics,” \nsuch as genomics and proteomics, focus on a different \nclass of molecule and its functions. Omics are central to \nthe development of bioengineering applications such as \nviral-vector gene therapy (which uses modified viruses \nto permanently replace poorly functioning genes that \ncause genetic diseases) and mRNA therapy (which uses \nmessenger RNA to trigger the synthesis of proteins that \ncan help prevent or fight disease).\n —Gene editing. A subset of genomics, gene editing \ncomprises techniques for modifying an organism’s DNA, \nusually using tools such as CRISPR-Cas9. \n —Tissue engineering. This technology enables the \nmodification of cells, tissues, and organs. Tissue \nengineering supports various human applications, such \nas development of transplantable biomaterials and the \ngeneration of human tissue replicas for drug studies. \nCultivated meat is an example of a product produced \nvia tissue engineering methods. It is made by taking \na sample of animal cells and growing it in a controlled \nenvironment to produce tissue that is similar to meat \nfrom whole animals.\n —Biomaterials. Materials made using bioengineering \ntechnology are known as biomaterials. They fall \ninto several different categories: bio-based drop-in \nchemicals (which can replace chemicals traditionally \nmade from petrochemicals without changing \nsurrounding operations), bioreplacements (new materials \nmade from bio-based chemicals that provide similar \nquality and cost but better environmental performance \nthan traditional chemicals), and biobetter materials \n(completely new materials produced via biochemical \nsynthesis).\nKey uncertainties \nThe major uncertainties affecting the future of \nbioengineering include the following:\n —Regulation of bioengineering technology and products \nwill play a part in governing the pace of advancements. \n —Public perceptions and ethical concerns regarding the \nsafety, cost, and quality of bioengineered products \ncould determine how quickly markets develop. Concerns \nabout modifying living organisms could also challenge \nadvancements. \n —Unintended consequences could occur, as biological \nsystems are self-replicating, self-sustaining, and highly \ninterconnected, and changes to one part of a system \ncan have negative cascading effects across an entire \necosystem or species.\nBig questions about the future\nCompanies and leaders may want to consider the following \nquestions when moving forward with bioengineering \ntechnologies: \n —How will society, in light of its diverse values and \nprinciples, determine an appropriate extent for genome \nediting?\n —In conjunction with business adoption, how will the public \nperceive and adopt bioengineering? For example, how \ndoes cultivated meat fit within existing diets?\n —How long will it take for a variety of CRISPR-based gene \ntherapies to come to fruition and become more socially \naccepted for a range of ailments?\n81Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nFuture of space technologies\nThe trend—and why it matters\nRapidly decreasing technology costs over the past decade \nhave given rise to an increase in the viability and relevance \nof space technologies. Lower costs, attributable to \nreductions in the size, weight, and power needs of satellites \nand launch vehicles, have led to a growing number of \nlaunches and applications for space technologies. We have \nseen the rise of wide-scale satellite internet connectivity—\npioneered by SpaceX-owned Starlink, with more than 5,000 \nlow-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites—and increased private-\nmarket involvement and innovation around launch vehicles. \nThe growing number of use cases has also attracted \nthe attention and investment,\n \nof non-space-technology \ncompanies that see a series of opportunities within the \nrealms of remote connectivity, Earth observation across \na spectrum of frequencies, and more. Revenues of the \nindustry’s “backbone”—that is, space hardware and service \nproviders—could potentially grow to more than $750 billion \nby 2035, but adoption of different space technologies varies \nwidely.\n1\n While some technologies are deployed and scaling \nrapidly, many activities of the future space industry, such as \nspace mining and on-orbit manufacturing, are still nascent \nand will have to navigate an array of technological and \ngeopolitical hurdles in the coming years.\nTalent demand Ratio\nof skilled people\nto job vacancies\nEquity investment \nPrivate- and public- \nmarket capital raises for \nrelevant technologies\nPatents Patent\n\u0006lings for technologies \nrelated to trend\nNews Press reports \nfeaturing trend-\nrelated phrases\nSearches Search \nengine queries for \nterms related to\ntrend\nResearch Scienti\u0006c \npublications on topics \nassociated with trend\n0.2\n0.1\nNews\nTalent demand\nResearch\nSearches\n0.3\nPatents\nEquity\ninvestment\nScore by vector (0 = lower; 1 = higher)\n20192023\nCUTTING\u0019EDGE ENGINEERING\n1.0\n0.3\n0\nScoring the trend\nFuture of space\ntechnologies\nSpace technology momentum scores have remained \nmodest—but shown steady increases—across all \ndimensions since 2019.\nIndustries a\u0003ected: Aerospace and defense; \nAgriculture; Aviation, travel, and logistics;\nTelecommunications\nAdoption score, 2023\n$9–9%\n12345\nFully\nscaled\nFrontier\ninnovation\nEquity investment,\n2023,\n$ billion\nJob postings,\n202223,\n% dierence\n1\n “Space: The $1.8 trillion opportunity for global economic growth,” McKinsey, April 8, 2024.\n82Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nLatest developments \nRecent developments involving space technologies include \nthe following: \n —LEO satellite communications constellations see \ncontinued growth. LEO satellite constellations are in \nvarious stages of planning and deployment, with multiple \ncompanies launching and deploying constellations for \ncommercial and government use. After only a few years \nof commercial operation, Starlink saw rapid growth in \n2023, reaching more than 2.3 million subscribers in over \n60 countries and launching new satellites into orbit every \nfew days.\n2\n Potential competitors, such as Amazon’s \nProject Kuiper, are testing their products in hopes of \nintroducing commercial service soon. \n —Interest and expected expansion of direct-to-device \nconnection continues. Following Apple’s release of its \ndirect-to-device (D2D) emergency connection on its \niPhone, companies have increased their focus on the \ntechnology to broaden their coverage to remote areas. \nSpaceX has completed successful tests in partnership \nwith T-Mobile.  Viasat and Skylo announced the world’s \nfirst global D2D network with industries such as \nagriculture, mining, and logistics as target customers.\n —Global launch activity increased. Excitement and \nattention about launches continued in 2023, with an \nestimated 223 attempted launches versus 186 in 2022, \na 20 percent increase.\n3\n Most of these launches are from \nUS-based companies, primarily SpaceX. However, there \nwas a significant uptick in activity from other countries, \nsuch as France and India, as they are starting to invest \nmore in space exploration and involvement. The debut \nof Vulcan Centaur—a new methane-fueled rocket from \nUnited Launch Alliance—in early 2024 marked the \nbeginning of two certification missions, adding a new \nlaunch alternative to the market. \n —Lunar activity continued within the private and public \nsectors. In January 2024, Japan successfully completed \nthe country’s first and the world’s most precise moon \nlanding ever. This event represents the expanded \ninterest in lunar landings across geographies between \nthe private and public spheres. A series of private \ncompanies, such as Astrobotic Technology and Intuitive \nMachines, have focused heavily on constructing lunar \nlanders, with Intuitive Machines’ Odysseus managing \nto land the first US spacecraft on the moon since 1972. \nNASA has recently selected Intuitive Machines, along \nwith Lunar Outpost and Venturi Astrolab, to advance \ncapabilities for the lunar terrain vehicle for Artemis \nastronauts, enabling them to conduct scientific research \non the moon and prepare for future Mars missions.\n4\n \n —Integration of offerings into end-to-end solutions is \ndriven by increased interest from non-space-technology \nsectors. Space technology companies are increasingly \nfocusing on providing end-to-end (E2E) solutions as the \nmarket matures and customers, particularly enterprises, \ndemand seamless integration with their existing \ninfrastructure and less complexity with implementation. \nWe see this through single partnerships between space \ntech companies (such as those offering D2D technology \nor remote sensing analytics) and enterprises in industries \nsuch as mining, agriculture, and sustainability that are \nseeking both hardware and software solutions. For \nexample, Planet Labs has contracts with Swiss Re and \nother insurers to use their satellites and software to both \nobserve and provide analytics to support parametric \nagriculture insurance.\n5\n‘Space continues to accelerate in the public \nconsciousness, yet adoption is uneven, and funding \nis increasingly flowing to “winners.” Real progress is \nbeing made to deliver on the promises of 2020–21.’  \n– Jesse Klempner, partner, Washington, DC\n2\n Magdalena Petrova, “Starlink’s rapid growth and influence has made it an indispensable part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX,” CNBC, November 11, 2023.\n3\n Jonathan McDowell, “Space activities in 2023,” January 15, 2024.\n4\n “NASA selects companies to advance moon mobility for Artemis missions,” NASA press release, April 3, 2024. \n5\n “How satellite data is changing agriculture insurance,” Planet Labs, December 6, 2023. \n83Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nJob postings by title, 2019–23, thousands\nDemand\nFuture of space technologies\nTalent and labor markets\nIn 2023, the prolonged growth streak of the space technology labor market tapered o\u0005.

Perhaps \nunsurprisingly, respondents from energy and materials and \ntelecommunications, media, and technology companies \nself-reported that they are scaling or have fully scaled more \nthan other industries, owing to how central connectivity and \nremote sensing are to these sectors. \nAdoption dimensions\nThe adoption trajectory for advanced technologies varies for \neach technology and each use case within that technology. \nAdvancements along the following dimensions could enable \nthe next level of adoption:\n —Technological evolution  facilitates easier access and \nharmonization of space data and creates opportunities for \nnew revenue streams to emerge. Improved accessibility \nand usability enable non-space-technology commercial \nplayers to embrace space data, breaking down technical \nbarriers and fostering innovative use cases.\n —Demand increase—for instance, through regulatory \nrequirements for observation of key metrics—could \nbe accomplished by space-based remote sensing in a \nbroader range of verticals. Substantial legislation where \nthird-party verification of emissions is either required or \nbeneficial, such as the EU Deforestation Regulation, can \ncreate incentives for enterprises to use space-based \ntechnologies to monitor their environmental impact. \nGrowth in demand is also enabled by an increasingly \nconnected and mobile world, generating demand for \nsatellite internet, positioning, and navigation services, \nand AI- and machine learning–powered insights for \nvarious applications, including disaster response and \nearly trendspotting.\n —Considerable decrease of implementation costs for \ncompanies, aided by further E2E integration of data, \nhardware, software, and science-based methods would \nenable more enterprises to access the technology, \nintegrating not only satellite data but also other relevant \ninsights. For example, it can help in the sustainability \nfield, with certifiable Scope 3 emissions calculations or \ncertification needs.\nIn real life \nReal-world examples involving the use of space \ntechnologies include the following:\n —John Deere formed a commercial partnership with \nSpaceX’s Starlink to bring D2D connectivity to its \nagricultural machinery. This will allow new features \non new and existing machines, such as real-time data \nsharing, enhanced self-repair options (for example, \nconnected support and software updates), and \nmachine-to-machine communication for farmers in \nremote locations.\n6\n  \n —Qatar Airways announced that it will begin installing \nStarlink on select planes for passenger Wi-Fi.

Modular small satellites can be custom \nbuilt—by using CubeSat architectures and standard-\nsize building blocks—to perform a widening variety of \nmissions.\n —Remote sensing. Full-spectrum imaging and monitoring \nare used to observe Earth’s features, such as \noceanography, weather, and geology.\n —SWaP-C advancements. Reductions in the size, weight, \npower, and cost (SWaP-C) of satellites and launch \nvehicles have increased the cost-effectiveness of space \ntechnology and associated use cases.\n —Launch technology advancements.

We see potential for more advanced \nlaunch technologies, such as nuclear propulsion. \n —Advanced-connectivity technologies. These \ntechnologies, including laser communications, \nelectronically scanned antennas, and automated \nsatellite operations, are expected to progress in the \ncoming years. \nKey uncertainties\nThe major uncertainties affecting the future of space \ntechnologies include the following:\n —Cost-effectiveness of space technologies is required to \nenable further scalability. \n —Governance mechanisms need to better define \nthe allocation of spectrum and orbit usage rights \nto accommodate the increasing number of players, \nsatellites, and applications.\n —Cyber risks, including data breaches, malware, and other \ncyberattacks, are growing in number and complexity \nbecause of the proliferation of commercial players.\nBig questions about the future\nCompanies and leaders may want to consider a few \nquestions when moving forward with space technologies: \n —How can leaders define ownership and access rights to \nspace and space technologies?\n —How can the industry build governance structures \naround key domains (for example, reducing unintentional \ninterference, promoting safe operations, protecting \nproperty rights and usage, determining liability, and \nencouraging equitable data sharing)?\n —How can stakeholders coordinate to manage space \ndebris and traffic effectively?\n —What will future satellite distribution look like (for \nexample, balance across orbits)?\n —How will the market evolve, given a variety of factors \n(macroeconomic, the push for E2E solutions, et cetera)?\n —How will competition evolve, within the private-launch \nmarket?\n —With increasing competition and the risk of interference \nand gridlock in spectrum usage, could the current \nspectrum allocation system endure?\n‘For so long, space has been fascinating yet far from \nreality. But now, it is one of the biggest influences \non our daily lives—from guiding us on our daily \ncommutes to facilitating disaster relief operations. \nSpace technologies enable impact on Earth.’  \n– Giacomo Gatto, partner, London\n86Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nA sustainable world\n87Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\nElectrification and renewables\nThe trend—and why it matters\nElectrification and renewable-energy technologies are crucial \nfor reducing global carbon emissions in accordance with the \nParis Agreement. Achieving the agreement’s goals requires a \n45 percent reduction in global emissions by 2030 and net-zero \nemissions by 2050.\n1\n \nFortunately, many of the technologies required to achieve these \nreductions already exist today and encompass the entire value \nchain of energy production, storage, and distribution. These \nincreasingly important solutions include renewable sources \nsuch as solar and wind power; clean firm-energy sources such \nas nuclear and hydrogen, sustainable fuels and bioenergy, and \nenergy storage; and distribution solutions such as long-duration \nbattery systems and smart grids.\nThe shift to clean energy will have far-reaching effects on both \nenergy-producing and energy-intensive sectors, and it will require \nsubstantial investments in physical assets for energy and land- \nuse systems. So far, the total investment in physical assets for \nenergy and land-use systems is still well below the $9.2 trillion \nannual investment required to reach net zero by 2050.\n2\n While \ncapacity, reliability constraints, and rising interest rates could \nslow the uptake of clean energy, growing capital spending can \nhelp accelerate adoption. Increased government support on \ninfrastructure and permitting could likely accelerate adoption as \nwell. As these technologies become more widespread, closing the \ntalent gap will also be critical: McKinsey research estimates that \nclimate technology value chains will require approximately 200 \nmillion skilled workers globally by 2050.\n3\n  \nTalent demand Ratio\nof skilled people\nto job vacancies\nEquity investment \nPrivate- and public- \nmarket capital raises for \nrelevant technologies\nPatents Patent\n\u0006lings for technologies \nrelated to trend\nNews Press reports \nfeaturing trend-\nrelated phrases\nSearches Search \nengine queries for \nterms related to\ntrend\nResearch Scienti\u0006c \npublications on topics \nassociated with trend\n0.4\n0.2\n0.6\n0.8\nNews\nTalent demand\nResearch\nSearches\n1.0\nPatents\nEquity\ninvestment\nScore by vector (0 = lower; 1 = higher)\n20192023\nA SUSTAINABLE WORLD\nElectri\u0018cation\nand renewables\n1.0\n0\nScoring the trend\nThe electri\u0006cation and renewables trend had the \nhighest investment and interest scores among all the \ntrends we evaluated, with innovation scores close to \nthe group average.¹ These positions align with the \nmaturity and scaling of renewable technologies, \nparticularly photovoltaic-solar and wind power. \nMoreover, they reect the level of investment required \nto meet global net-zero pathways.\nIndustries a\u0003ected: Agriculture; Automotive and \nassembly; Aviation, travel, and logistics; Chemicals; \nConstruction and building materials; Electric power, \nnatural gas, and utilities; Metals and mining; Oil and \ngas; Real estate\nAdoption score, 2023\n$183+1%\n12345\nFully\nscaled\nFrontier\ninnovation\nEquity investment,\n2023,\n$ billion\nJob postings,\n202223,\n% dierence\n¹PitchBook data for closed deals across all investment types, based on keywords \n(consistent with the 2022 Global Energy Perspective report).\n1\n “For a livable climate: Net-zero commitments must be backed by credible action,” United Nations Environment Programme, November 2023. \n2\n Mekala Krishnan and Lola Woetzel, “Infrastructure for a net-zero economy: Transformation ahead,” McKinsey, April 6, 2022. \n3\n “What would it take to scale critical climate technologies?,” McKinsey, December 1, 2023. \n88Technology Trends Outlook 2024\n\n89Technology Trends Outlook 2024\nLatest developments in 2023\nRecent developments involving electrification and \nrenewables include the following:\n —Renewable generation grows amid challenges.

Recent \nincentives such as the US Clean Hydrogen Production \nTax Credit, the EU Important Projects of Common \nEuropean Interest, and the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen \nAgreement demonstrate growing interest in public \nsector support for advancing the green-hydrogen \necosystem and ultimately allow for economies of \nscale despite existing cost barriers.\n6\n Despite the new \nincentives, private sector hydrogen adoption remains \nrelatively small, with only 1.0 percent of global production \n(and 0.7 percent of demand in existing applications) \ncoming from low-emission hydrogen.\n7\n Factors \ncontributing to slow adoption include the challenge to \nbalance clean-hydrogen production with the growing \ndemand for power, the high-interest-rate environment, \nand incentives that mainly target new applications \ninstead of scaling existing uses. \n —Global battery storage capacity is scaling rapidly. In \n2023, lithium-ion battery pack prices dropped by 14 \npercent and are expected to decline further in 2024, \nwith demand for mobile and stationary battery storage \nincreasing by more than 50 percent year over year.\n8\n  \nMcKinsey analysis projects that demand for lithium-ion \nbatteries will scale up to six times to 4,700 gigawatt-\nhours by 2030, with mobility applications encompassing \na vast majority of the market.\n9\n Established policy \nincentives, including Europe’s Fit for 55 program, the \nUS Inflation Reduction Act, the European Union’s 2035 \nban on internal-combustion-engine vehicles, and \nIndia’s scheme for faster adoption and manufacture of \nhybrid vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs), demonstrate \npublic sector interest in continued EV adoption. \nHowever, widespread adoption of EVs will likely \nhinge on the expansion of charging infrastructure, as \nwell as improvements in mileage and performance. \nInnovations such as solid-state batteries, which promise \nsignificant enhancements, are still years away from \ncommercialization. \n —Policy incentives look to spur stalled heat pump \nadoption.

These devices store chemical energy \nand convert it into electricity. They are applicable to \ntraditional energy sources as well as renewables such as \nwind and solar.\n —Heat pumps. These devices extract heat from a source \n(that is, from air, ground, or water) and transfer that heat \nfrom evaporator to condenser, proving to be 2.0 to 4.5 \ntimes more efficient than a traditional furnace or boiler.\n18 \n \nThey also function as air conditioners, transferring heat \nfrom internal spaces to outside.\n —Energy storage. These technologies, including \nbatteries, capture energy from various sources, such \nas electrochemical, thermal, mechanical, and chemical \nsystems, to be used later.\n19\n \n —Nuclear fission. Nuclear fission, the process of splitting \nlarge atoms to create energy, is a proven zero-carbon \npower source. Concerns about accidents and radioactive \nwaste persist. However, the growing demand for clean \nenergy is reinvigorating efforts to expand nuclear power \ncapabilities. (There is also growing interest in nuclear \nfusion, the process of combining small atoms to produce \nenergy, but significant technical challenges remain to be \nsolved.)\n —Renewables. These are energy sources produced by \nnatural power resources. New technologies such as \nadvanced solar photovoltaics and both onshore and \noffshore wind turbines are driving significant growth \nfrom traditional renewable sources.\n —Hydrogen. This is a versatile energy carrier that can be \nproduced with minimal or zero-carbon emissions using \nelectrochemical energy conversion technologies.\n —Sustainable fuels. These are fuel alternatives to \ntraditional fossil hydrocarbon fuels, including both low-\ncarbon fuels and fuels derived from natural or alternative \nfeedstock (for example, biomass, hydrogen, e-ammonia, \nand e-methanol-based fuels). \nOpportunities to leverage other tech trends with \nelectrification and renewables technologies include the \nfollowing: \n —Future of mobility.

This \nis evidenced by a moderate increase in targets across \nvarious dimensions and a more notable surge in \ncorporate climate commitments. Currently, about 80 \npercent of companies in the Fortune Global 500 have \nset carbon reduction targets. Beyond carbon, the \ndimensions attracting the most attention include water, \nchemicals and plastic, biodiversity, and forests. The year \n2023 witnessed a 30 percent year-over-year increase \nin the number of companies setting targets in three or \nmore dimensions of nature (for example, air, water, land).\n4\n  \nEurope has the greatest share of companies with nature \ntargets, likely galvanized by a set of nature-related \nregulations, including the Corporate Sustainability \nReporting Directive, EU Deforestation Regulation, and—\nmost recently—the EU Nature Restoration Law. Similar \npublic sector action in other regions could encourage \ncompanies in all sectors to implement nature-positive \nlevers with opportunities for an annual net benefit of up \nto $700 billion.\n5\n  \n —The adoption of agriculture technology (agtech) \nsolutions for sustainable farming is growing, though \npenetration is currently relatively low. While sustainable \nagricultural practices that require behavior change \n(such as cover crops and afforestation of degraded \ncropland) have the highest adoption, practices that \nleverage technology and require a product or equipment \nchange are not adopted at full scale yet, according to \nthe latest US farmer survey.\n6\n However, we see advances \nin these agtech solutions. For example, variable-rate \nfertilizer applications (VRA) benefit from advances in \nAI to generate high-precision VRA maps to account \nfor field variability. This can help reduce the amount of \nfertilizer applied, which, in turn, reduces greenhouse \ngas emissions caused by excess nitrogen. Similarly, \nweed control robots are advancing and allow for \nthe reduction of tillage and herbicide applications, \nwhich benefits carbon sequestration and reduces \nwater pollution. Satellite-enabled remote-sensing \ntechnologies help to assess reduced tillage, sustainable \npractices for cover crops, and plant health. Further \nadoption of these technologies requires helping farmers \novercome operational challenges and the risks that \nnew technologies might entail—for example, through \ninsurance and the promotion of potential yield, cost, and \nrevenue benefits (such as carbon credits).\n —Public sector support for carbon management initiatives \nis increasing. Government agencies across the globe are \nleveraging a number of instruments, including grants, \nregulations, and tax breaks, to support the development \nand adoption of carbon management technologies. \nFor example, in addition to other investments, the US \nDepartment of Energy recently awarded $13 million \nin funding to 23 projects focused on R&D in carbon \ncapture through the Office of Fossil Energy and \nCarbon Management.\n7\n This funding aims to support \ninnovative solutions and advancements in carbon \ncapture technologies. Furthermore, the US Department \nof Energy has allocated up to $1.2 billion, through the \nOffice of Clean Energy Demonstrations, to support two \ndirect air capture (DAC) projects in Louisiana and Texas.\n8\n \nThese DAC hubs could play a crucial role in developing \nand demonstrating large-scale carbon removal \ntechnologies. These initiatives from the Department of \nEnergy may indicate a significant focus on addressing \ncarbon management challenges and accelerating the \ndevelopment of sustainable solutions in the fight against \nclimate change.\n —Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) has seen \na step change in interest. In the past year, the global \nCCUS market has seen a step change in interest. If all \nannounced projects in the pipeline are realized by 2030, \ncurrent capacity could increase by 12 times.\n9\n However, \nmany of these projects still need confirmed funding and \nfinal decisions on executing the buildout. This projected \nincrease in interest coincides with a proliferation of \nCCUS start-ups, new technologies, and private sector \ninterest in forward agreements and long-term carbon \nofftakes. These agreements allow developers to \nfinance CCUS infrastructure more easily, since they can \ndemonstrate proof of an existing customer base prior to \nconstruction. Such market dynamics are encouraging \nsigns for global net-zero ambitions, considering the \nexpectation that CCUS capacity needs are expected to \nincrease by over 100 times by 2050.\n4\n “Companies are broadening their commitments to nature beyond carbon,” McKinsey, December 8, 2023.\n5\n Nature in the balance: What companies can do to restore natural capital, McKinsey, December 5, 2022.\n6\n    “Voice of the US farmer 2023–24: Farmers seek path to scale sustainably,” McKinsey, April 9, 2024.\n7\n “DOE invests over $13 million for projects that capture carbon emissions from industrial facilities, power plants, air, and oceans,” Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon \nManagement, August 9, 2023.\n8\n “Biden-Harris administration announces up to $1.2 billion for nation’s first direct air capture demonstrations in Texas and Louisiana,” US Department of Energy, \nAugust 11, 2023.\n9\n “Global Energy Perspective 2023,” January 24, 2024.\n\nJob postings by title, 2019–23, thousands\nDemand\nClimate technologies beyond electri\rcation and renewables\nTalent and labor markets\nBetween 2019 and 2022, climate technologies beyond electri\u0006cation and renewables saw signi\u0006cant growth, \nwith job postings increasing by over 96 percent (25 percent CAGR).

The utilization of CO₂ and its \nsale as a product offer a revenue source to offset  \nthe cost of capture. One of the primary uses of CO₂  \ntoday is enhanced oil recovery; other uses also are \ngaining momentum.\n14\n \n —Engineered carbon removal. Various technologies can \nremove atmospheric CO\n2\n, including direct air capture and \nstorage, bioenergy carbon capture and storage, biochar \nand bio-oil, and enhanced weathering. \nOpportunities for the integration of climate technologies \nbeyond electrification and renewables with other tech \ntrends include the following:\n —Applied AI. AI technologies can be used to increase the \nefficacy and efficiency of carbon capture systems.\n —Advanced connectivity. Advanced connectivity can \nimprove real-time crop monitoring and automated  \nmicro-irrigation.\n —Future of bioengineering. Bioengineering can help in  \nthe development of genetically modified varieties of \ntrees, crops, and seaweed that absorb more carbon with \nfewer inputs.\n —Future of space technologies. More advanced satellites \ncan monitor CO\n2\n concentrations and soil and ocean \nhealth and validate, quantify, and authenticate carbon \nmanagement schemes. \n13\n “Digging in: Cargill’s regenerative agriculture program brings healthier soil and profits to more European, U.S. farmers,” Cargill, May 23, 2023.\n14\n   “Scaling the CCUS industry to achieve net-zero emissions,” McKinsey, October 28, 2022.\n\n‘Nature is the technology that we have available today \nfor the next critical decade and can help solve the net-\nzero equation. If you want to think about a cost-effective \nway of capturing carbon or avoiding carbon loss today, \nit is through natural systems. And nature’s import goes \nfar beyond its role in the climate: let’s not forget we are \ndependent on it for our lives and livelihoods.’  \n– Joshua Katz, partner, Stamford\n99Technology Trends Outlook 2024\nKey uncertainties affecting the trend \nThe major uncertainties affecting climate technologies \nbeyond electrification and renewables include the following:\n —Public sector incentives such as potential policies and \nregulations could be pivotal in shaping investment \ndecisions, business case viability, and public reactions to \ncarbon management schemes. \n —Natural-capital valuation through different carbon \nmanagement incentive structures allows organizations \nto apply varying valuations for the cobenefits of natural-\ncapital solutions, relative to pure CO\n2\n removal. \n —Coordination throughout the value chain could be a \nchallenge, as scaling carbon abatement and removal \ninfrastructure is time and capital intensive. The need for \ncoordination between public and private stakeholders at \nthe local level could be an additional obstacle.\n —Standardization of the carbon market could prove \ndifficult, as it is unclear how recent commitments by \nindependent carbon credit standards to enhance \ntransparency and consistency will affect trust in carbon \nmanagement schemes to follow through on promises. \nBig questions about the future\nCompanies and leaders may want to consider a few \nquestions when moving forward with climate technologies \nbeyond electrification and renewables:\n —How will carbon management schemes overcome \npotential bottlenecks (for instance, raw materials, land, \nand infrastructure) as R&D, experience, and economies \nof scale help propel adoption?\n —How will debates about the efficacy of nature-based \ncarbon removals compared with technology-based \ncarbon removals affect investment decisions and public \nperception? \n —Can innovations in CCUS technologies lead to significant \ncost reductions and expanded use cases? \n —Can independent carbon credit agencies successfully \nmeet certification criteria and increase scoring \ntransparency to build trust and reliability in the voluntary \ncarbon market? \n —How will consumers react to the continued innovations in \nalternative proteins?\n\n \nMcKinsey & Company \nJuly 2024 \nCopyright © McKinsey & Company \n \nAll photography © Getty Images \nDesigned by McKinsey Global Publishing \n \nwww.McKinsey.com\nffflfi–ffi-ffi₂\u0018\u0017–\u0016\u0018fi\u0015ffi-ffi\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0011\u0018–fi\u0016\u0010\u000f\u0013\nffflfi–ffi-₂\u0018\u0017ffi\u0016₂fi\u0015\u0017fi\u0015ffi\u0014fl\u0013\u0017ffi\u0015\u0012fl\u0011ffi₂fiffi\u0015\u0012\u0017ffi\nffflfi–ffi-₂\u0018\u0017\u0016ffi-–\u0015\u0014\u0013-\u0017\u0012\u0011\u0011",
