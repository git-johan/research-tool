I don't explicitly ask the users these questions, but we talk around the topics.\n\nI show them the attached designs.\n\nHelp me understand:\n\n* Does the user get enough information to trust the estimated future value?\n* Does the user get enough information to trust the the comparisons to other products in the same category?\n* Does the user get enough information to trust the scores?\n* How does the feature in general impact the user's purchase decision?\n\nDon't recommend design changes, just summarise the insights.\n\nI'll share one interview at a time.\n\nRespond in Markup, please.\n```",
