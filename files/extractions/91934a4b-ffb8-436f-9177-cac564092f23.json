How Tings Convert affects decision-making**\n\n- The presence of Tings Convert helps the user **justify purchases** by emphasizing resale potential, making high-priced items feel more viable.\n- It introduces the idea of **circularity** in consumption, which aligns with growing environmental consciousness.\n- The user notes that integrating Tings Convert into the shopping process could streamline **future resale**, making it an appealing feature.\n- The feature positively influences decision-making if it is perceived as **user-friendly and accurate**.\n\n**3. Most important aspects of Tings Convert**\n\n- **“Gjensalgsverdi” (Resale Value in 2 years):** The user sees this as the most impactful metric, aiding in justifying high-cost purchases.\n- **“Salgstid” (Time to Sell):** Viewed as a practical metric, though less critical than resale value.\n- **“Materialscore”:** Considered informative but secondary compared to resale value and ease of resale.\n- Showing “Estimert verdi om 2 år” (Estimated Value in 2 Years) instead of “Gjensalgbarhet” was well-received for its clarity and focus.\n\n**4. Trust in Tings Convert**\n\n- The user expressed **moderate trust (80%)** in the information provided, with some skepticism regarding whether factors like color and design were accounted for.\n- The inclusion of brand-specific data (e.g., Brynje) lends credibility but requires transparency in methodology for full trust.\n\n**5. Dislikes or drawbacks**\n\n- Skepticism about the algorithm’s comprehensiveness, particularly its ability to account for **subjective factors** like aesthetic preferences (e.g., color).\n- Concerns about the feature being too complex or overwhelming for users unfamiliar with second-hand markets.\n- Some features, like “Materialscore,” may feel unnecessary or less relevant for decision-making compared to others.\n\n**6. Key insights for future iterations**\n\n- Focus on **Gjensalgsverdi** as the primary metric, with clear, straightforward language like “Estimert verdi om 2 år.”\n- Build trust by providing **transparency about data sources** and how resale potential is calculated.\n- Simplify the interface to avoid overwhelming users, highlighting key metrics most relevant to decision-making.\n- Explore integration with **resale platforms** (e.g., Finn) to enhance the perceived value and practicality of Tings Convert.\n- Address concerns about visual and subjective factors (e.g., style, color) to improve perceived accuracy and user trust.\n\n# Designs\n\n![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5547bd14-87d8-45b4-beb9-00974cf0ac7c/8db72b0a-7f75-4b75-a304-58ce26646219/image.png)",
