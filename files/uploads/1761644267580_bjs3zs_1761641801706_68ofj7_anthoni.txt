**1. Decision-Making Process Without Tings Convert**

- The user typically evaluates product reviews, price comparisons, and quality.
- Price and potential discounts are primary concerns.
- They value durability but don’t initially consider resale potential, especially for items like jackets.
- For more significant purchases, such as an electric bike, resale value and condition are key considerations.
- The user associates high-quality products with lasting value and often compares items across marketplaces.

**2. How Tings Convert Affects Decision-Making**

- Tings Convert makes the user think more about a product’s resale value and lifespan.
- Seeing resale metrics (e.g., second-hand value and selling time) reassures them about the product’s quality and future utility.
- The inclusion of resale data adds confidence, especially for brands or products the user is less familiar with.
- The user feels more informed about their choice, seeing it as a safer and more rational decision.

**3. Most Important Aspects of Tings Convert**

- **Resale Value (“Gjensalgsverdi”)**: The user finds this highly reassuring as it indicates the product’s quality and expected longevity. Knowing they could recoup 40–60% of the original price positively influences their decision.
- **Selling Time (“Salgstid”)**: They appreciate this information but prioritize it less than resale value. Quick selling times for popular items add to their confidence.
- **Material Score (“Materialscore”)**: While interesting, it is the least significant factor for the user’s decision-making. They focus more on tangible resale metrics.
- Alternative metric: **“Estimert verdi om 2 år”** resonates as it directly relates to potential financial outcomes.

**4. Trust in Tings Convert**

- The user expresses a reasonable level of trust in the tool, particularly when it supports decisions for unfamiliar brands.
- Trust increases when Tings Convert aligns with their perception of the product as high quality.
- Metrics like resale value are seen as reliable indicators of product durability and popularity.
- Trust may waver if scores are ambiguous or too low without clear explanations.

**5. Dislikes or Drawbacks**

- The user may feel skeptical about unknown brands even with high Tings Convert scores.
- Material scores and environmental factors, while appreciated, are not top priorities for this user.
- Some skepticism arises from a lack of familiarity with Tings Convert itself, as they are not yet accustomed to integrating resale data into their purchasing process.

**6. Key Insights for Future Iterations**

- Focus on **resale value** and **selling time** metrics to drive user confidence and decision-making.
- Simplify or contextualize material scores, as they are less intuitive for users.
- Offer clear explanations of how scores are calculated to build trust, particularly for unfamiliar brands.
- Highlight how Tings Convert adds value for sustainable purchasing, which could resonate with environmentally conscious users.
