# Summary

### 1. **Does the user get enough information to trust the estimated future value?**

- **Insights:**
  - The user finds the resale value estimate helpful, particularly as a way to justify the purchase by reducing the perceived financial risk.
  - Skepticism arises around the basis of the valuation, with a desire for transparency on how estimates are calculated (e.g., sales history, specific criteria).
  - Users are reassured when additional details are available, such as examples of actual resale prices or validation from trusted sources.
  - Trust in the estimate improves if the source is familiar or reputable (e.g., Trustpilot or known retailers).

### 2. **Does the user get enough information to trust the comparisons to other products in the same category?**

- **Insights:**
  - Comparisons, like “better than 92% of products in the category,” draw attention but raise questions about credibility and data sources.
  - While such comparisons are seen as valuable, the user expressed a need for more clarity on the methodology or evidence supporting the claim.

---

### 3. **Does the user get enough information to trust the scores?**

- **Insights:**
  - Scores like “8/10” or “better than 92%” provide a quick impression but feel abstract without supporting data.
  - Users prefer a combination of numerical scores and clear explanations or data to build trust in the scoring system.
  - Trust in scores would improve if they were linked to verifiable sources or supported by detailed breakdowns.

### 4. **How does the feature in general impact the user's purchase decision?**

- **Insights:**
  - The feature helps users feel more confident in committing to higher-priced purchases by framing the item as an investment with potential resale value.
  - It shifts the user's perspective from viewing the purchase as a sunk cost to seeing it as part of a lifecycle.
  - While the feature may not immediately impact every purchase, it encourages users to consider resale and circular economy principles in future buying decisions.
  - For users less familiar with resale practices, the feature acts as a gentle nudge to explore and potentially engage in the secondary market.
  - Integration with trusted retailers positively influences the perception of both the retailer and the feature itself.

I want you to help me answer two questions based on transcriptions from user interviews I've conducted. I don't explicitly ask the users these questions, but we talk around the topics.

I show them the attached designs.

Help me understand:

* Does the user get enough information to trust the estimated future value?
* Does the user get enough information to trust the the comparisons to other products in the same category?
* Does the user get enough information to trust the scores?
* How does the feature in general impact the user's purchase decision?

Don't recommend design changes, just summarise the insights.

I'll share one interview at a time.

Respond in Markup, please.
