# Test Plan: Modular File Processing

## Automated Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for file upload validation and storage
- [ ] Unit tests for each file format extractor (PDF, DOCX, HTML, CSV, MD, TXT)
- [ ] Unit tests for AI formatting service
- [ ] Unit tests for vector indexing pipeline
- [ ] Integration tests for complete file processing workflow
- [ ] Error handling tests for unsupported file types
- [ ] Error handling tests for malformed files
- [ ] Error handling tests for network failures during processing
- [ ] Performance tests for large file processing
- [ ] Memory usage tests for concurrent file processing

## Manual Tests (Request User)
- [ ] UI testing for file upload interface with all supported formats
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing: upload → extract → format → index → search
- [ ] Status progression visibility testing (uploaded → extracted → formatted → indexed)
- [ ] Error recovery testing: retry failed stages without re-uploading
- [ ] Migration testing: verify existing documents still work
- [ ] Cross-browser testing for file upload functionality
- [ ] Accessibility testing for upload interface

## Performance Tests
- [ ] Load testing with multiple simultaneous file uploads
- [ ] Processing time comparison: new pipeline vs current system
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring during large file processing
- [ ] Search performance validation after indexing through new pipeline
- [ ] Database performance impact of new status tracking
