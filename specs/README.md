# Feature Specifications for Solo AI-Assisted Development

This directory enforces **spec-first development** for a solo developer working with AI to think through problems before building.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Always create a spec before coding.** Specs are thinking tools that help you and AI work through problems systematically. The goal is to build better development habits by forcing structured thinking upfront.

## 🤖 Your AI-Assisted Workflow

### The Complete Cycle
```
💡 Idea → 🤝 AI Discussion → ✅ Spec Approval → 💾 Save Spec →
🔨 Build → 🔄 Iterate → 🧪 Test → ✅ Complete
```

### 1. **Starting with an Idea**
When you have an idea, immediately start a spec:
```bash
./scripts/new-spec.sh "your-idea-name"
```

**Best Practice**: Never start coding without a spec. If it's worth building, it's worth thinking through first.

### 2. **AI Collaboration for Spec Creation**
- **Discuss the problem** with AI before jumping to solutions
- **Explore edge cases** and potential issues
- **Break down implementation** into concrete steps
- **Define acceptance criteria** so you know when you're done

**Template sections optimized for AI discussion:**
- **Problem**: What exactly are you trying to solve?
- **Solution**: High-level approach (discuss alternatives with AI)
- **Implementation Plan**: Concrete steps (AI helps break this down)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How will you know it works?

### 3. **Spec Approval & Commitment**
Once you and AI have refined the spec:
- ✅ **Approve the final version**
- ✅ **Commit and push** (triggers automation)
- ✅ **GitHub issue created automatically**
- ✅ **You're now committed to following this plan**

## 📖 The Challenge: Actually Following Your Specs

### Making Specs Visible While Coding
- **Keep the spec open** in a browser tab or second monitor
- **Reference the GitHub issue** during development
- **Check off Implementation Plan items** as you complete them

### Implementation Discipline
```bash
# Good commit messages reference the spec:
git commit -m "feat: implement PDF extraction stage

Addresses implementation plan item 2 from #123
- Add mammoth library for DOCX processing
- Create extractor routing system"
```

### When to Update vs. Stick to Spec
**Update the spec when:**
- You discover the problem is different than expected
- Technical constraints require a different approach
- Requirements change based on learning

**Stick to the spec when:**
- You're tempted to add "quick features" (scope creep)
- Implementation feels harder than expected
- You want to skip "boring" parts like error handling

## 🔄 Status Progression for Solo Development

| Status | What It Means | Your Actions |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Draft** | Discussing with AI, refining the spec | Keep iterating until you approve |
| **In Progress** | Actively building this feature | Follow the implementation plan |
| **Review** | Built and testing against acceptance criteria | Verify all criteria are met |
| **Complete** | Feature fully implemented and tested | Close issue, celebrate! |

## 📋 Managing Multiple Ideas/Specs

### Capturing Ideas Quickly
```bash
# Create specs for all your ideas
./scripts/new-spec.sh "mobile-responsive-ui"
./scripts/new-spec.sh "user-authentication"
./scripts/new-spec.sh "performance-optimization"

# Set priorities in the spec frontmatter
**Priority:** High | Medium | Low
```

### Working on Multiple Features
- **One "In Progress" at a time** - finish what you start
- **Keep others in Draft** until you're ready to commit
- **Use GitHub issues** to track which features are ready to build

### Priority Management
- **High**: Critical features blocking other work
- **Medium**: Important improvements, nice to have
- **Low**: Future ideas, experimental features

## ✅ Completion Best Practices

### Before Marking Complete
- [ ] All Implementation Plan items checked off
- [ ] All Acceptance Criteria verified
- [ ] Feature tested in realistic scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

### The Automation Handles
- ✅ **GitHub issue closure** when you mark spec as Complete
- ✅ **Spec validation** ensures required sections exist
- ✅ **Auto-sync** between spec files and GitHub issues
- ✅ **Change tracking** with automatic comments

## 🛠️ Development Integration

### Branch Naming
```bash
# Branch naming that references the issue
git checkout -b feature/issue-123-pdf-extraction
git checkout -b fix/issue-456-login-bug
```

### Commit Messages
```bash
# Reference the issue and implementation plan
git commit -m "feat: add DOCX extraction support

Implements stage 2 of modular file processing (#123)
- Add mammoth library integration
- Create DOCX-specific error handling
- Update file type routing logic"
```

### Pull Request Creation
```bash
# Auto-link PRs to issues
gh pr create --title "Feature: Modular File Processing" --body "
## Summary
Implements the modular file processing system from issue #123

## Implementation Status
- [x] Universal file upload
- [x] Content extraction routing
- [x] AI-powered formatting
- [x] Vector indexing
- [x] All acceptance criteria verified

Closes #123
"
```

## 🚀 Automation Features (Currently Working)

### ✅ **Spec-to-Issue Sync**
- Spec changes automatically update GitHub issues
- Sync comments added with commit references
- Real-time content synchronization

### ✅ **Quality Validation**
- Required sections validation
- Frontmatter format checking
- Auto-formatting for consistency
- GitHub issue link verification

### ✅ **Manual Fallbacks**
```bash
# If automation fails, manual tools available:
./scripts/spec-to-issue.sh specs/features/feature-name.md
./scripts/sync-spec.sh specs/features/feature-name.md
```

## 💡 Tips for Better Spec Discipline

### Getting Better at Following Specs
1. **Print out the Implementation Plan** and check items off physically
2. **Set small milestones** - commit after each implementation step
3. **Review acceptance criteria** before declaring "done"
4. **Resist scope creep** - capture new ideas as separate specs

### AI Collaboration Best Practices
- **Be specific about constraints** (time, technical limitations)
- **Ask AI to challenge your assumptions** about the problem
- **Request breakdown of complex tasks** into smaller steps
- **Have AI help with edge case analysis**

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Starting to code before spec is approved
- ❌ Making major changes without updating the spec
- ❌ Skipping acceptance criteria verification
- ❌ Working on multiple "In Progress" specs simultaneously

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### When Automation Fails
```bash
# Manual sync to GitHub issue
./scripts/sync-spec.sh specs/features/your-spec.md

# Manual issue creation
./scripts/spec-to-issue.sh specs/features/your-spec.md

# Check workflow logs
gh run list --limit 5
```

### When You've Gone Off-Spec
1. **Stop coding** and assess the deviation
2. **Update the spec** to reflect new understanding
3. **Commit the spec changes** first
4. **Continue with updated plan**

**Remember**: Specs aren't bureaucracy - they're thinking tools that make you a better developer by forcing you to solve problems in your head before solving them in code.
