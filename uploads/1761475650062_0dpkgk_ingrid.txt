- **Insights:**
  - The user mentioned that scores (e.g., "8/10 resale value") feel less tangible compared to specific resale value ranges. Scores alone may seem abstract and less actionable.
  - Trust in scores improves if accompanied by clear explanations or data supporting the rating, such as how long the item remains popular or material longevity.
